I\'m a professor at Michigan State University, where I study biology and bioinformatics. I\'m also interested in testing and test tools; I\'m the author of [figleaf](http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/README.html) and [twill](http://twill.idyll.org/), among other packages.

For the 2009 Google Summer of Code, I\'ve written up a few ideas on my blog; check \'em out here, [http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-09/gsoc-projects.html](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-09/gsoc-projects.html). I\'m not proposing to mentor all of them ;), but I will find mentors for interested students.
