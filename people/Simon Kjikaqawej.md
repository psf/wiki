## Programming Experience 

I\'m newbie programmer, and long-time Python user. I\'ve tried programming before, but lacked a project that would hold my interest long enough, but I\'ve found one now. Working on an IRC bot plugin, and I\'ve spent the last 2 weeks learning everything I can ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":)") . I used to do basic shell scripts to ease automation of my Linux-based machines, so the basic concepts aren\'t new to me.

## Personal 

I\'m a Mi\'kmaq and Abenaki (look them up on Wikipedia) by decent.
