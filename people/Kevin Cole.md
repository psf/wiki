Like Howard the Duck, \"trapped in a world he never made\", I\'m a procedural guy living in an object-oriented world \-- not to mention that I\'m surrounded by vi heathens who\'ve not yet seen the light of the One True Editor.

I\'m a programmer for the Gallaudet Research Institute, the Ubuntu Linux Washington, DC [LoCo](./LoCo.html) contact, and occasional writer of tutorials and tips for the less technical folks.
