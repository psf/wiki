# HowTo

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
As Wikipedia describes, \"A how-to or a how to is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish some specific task. A how-to is generally meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.\"

These [HowTos](./HowTos.html){.nonexistent} are intended to give brief, specific, focused, immediate instructions for accomplishing certain tasks with-, or for-, Python.
