# NumArray

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
NumArray was a reimplementation of Numeric. It has been phased out in favor of [NumPy](NumPy).

Its web page was [http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray](http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray){.http} (no longer works)

[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/){.http} is the reimplementation of Numeric. As both developers of Numeric and Numarray have moved to [NumPy](NumPy), [NumPy](NumPy) is a good choice for new applications.
