# OpenKomodo

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
The very feature-rich, multi-platform editor for scripting languages by ActiveState, Komodo Edit, was released as a zero-cost and open-sourced application in November of 2007.

[http://www.openkomodo.com/](http://www.openkomodo.com/){.http}

Komodo Edit is fully built out of this source tree:

[http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo](http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo){.http}

To try to help alleviate some confusion:

- OpenKomodo is the chosen name for Komodo-related things that have been open sourced \-- all of which is in the svn.openkomodo.com repository.

- The [http://www.openkomodo.com/](http://www.openkomodo.com/){.http} website is meant to provide details about open-source Komodo things.

- The primary open source Komodo IDE is the \"Komodo Edit\" editor.
