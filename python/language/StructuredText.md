The basic idea behind StructuredText is to avoid the necessity for a markup language like TeX, Troff or HTML/SGML/XML and being able to create richly structured documents without thinking about the markup. The StructuredText markup language is intiutive, minimal and unobtrusive.

There are several different versions of StructuredText:

- [ClassicStructuredText](ClassicStructuredText)

- [StructuredTextNG](http://dev.zope.org/Members/jim/StructuredTextWiki/StructuredTextNG)

- [Setext](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext/)

- [reStructuredText](reStructuredText) - intended primarily for documentation

- [PyTextile](PyTextile) - intended for web use

One application of StructuredText which is currently discussed on the [DocSig](DocSig) is the generation of documentation from Python [DocStrings](./DocStrings.html).

See [TextFilter](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TextFilter "Wiki") for more information on text filters, like StructuredText. We have a bit of information about StructuredText [mark up](./StructuredText(2f)MarkUp.html).
