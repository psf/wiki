# Observer Pattern 

**Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Described in [ObserverPattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObserverPattern "Wiki").

Common incarnations of the Observer Pattern use events to notify observers about changes in the subject. A python solution that encapsulates event triggering and subscription and mimics C#-style events can be found [here](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/410686).
