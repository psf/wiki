## Pros {#Pros}

kirbybase is a pure-python, flat-file, plain-text database management system. It can be used either embedded in a python application or in a client/server, multi-user mode. You can use python expressions/regular expressions in your query statement rather than having to use another language in your code such as sql. It is small and very easy to install (1 file). It understands python field types and lets you store your data in: strings, integers, floats, booleans, and datetime.date/datetime.datetime formats.

## Cons {#Cons}

It does not support joins, referential integrity, indexes, triggers, transactions, and some of the other things you will find in other databases. Performance on very large tables will suffer. Python 2.6 breaks the \"select\" function, and further development appears to have ceased in 2006.
