### Overview {#Overview}

- Place: **Symantec Vcafe, 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043**

- Map and directions to Symantec Vcafe: [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Symantec+VCAFE&jsv=147d&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.176833,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ei=rmSmSYKEHpnmiwP35u3_Dw&cd=2&cid=37397198,-122053292,16258400465366002656&li=lmd&z=14](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Symantec+VCAFE&jsv=147d&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.176833,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ei=rmSmSYKEHpnmiwP35u3_Dw&cd=2&cid=37397198,-122053292,16258400465366002656&li=lmd&z=14){.http}

- Closest Caltrain: Mountain View at Castro Street, which is right next to the Mountain View light rail station. Google Maps estimates it\'s 1.8 ml / 36 min walk, or 21 min by VTA. (Do people need to ask for rideshares from MV Caltrain?)

- VTA stop: Middlefield station (behind buildings, but directly across Ellis street from the Symantec building) [http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html](http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html){.http}

- VTA schedule (southbound, weekdays): [http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902SO_WK.html](http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902SO_WK.html){.http}

- VTA schedule (northbound, weekdays): [http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902NO_WK.html](http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902NO_WK.html){.http}

### Security {#Security}

- There is no need for badging or sign in. No security personnel are present.

### Parking {#Parking}

- Symantec has sufficient exterior parking spaces to the south of the building at that time of day. There is no street parking due to bike lanes.

### Logistics {#Logistics}

- This venue is used by the ACCU and SVLUG groups and for their meetings one of the doors to the cafeteria/fitness building is left unlocked for entry. It is normally the closest door that is east of the presentation area.
- Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending. An example has been provided.
