Fred used to be the guy that handled formatting the standard Python documentation for releases, and spent some time maintaining it, until he handed off that task to Georg Brandl and his amazing new system for the documentation. (Thanks, Georg!)

He works at [Zope Corporation](http://www.zope.com/){.http}, where\'s he\'s worked on all sorts of stuff, including [ZConfig](http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zconfig/){.http}. He spends most of his time there building content management systems and other parts of the product line.
