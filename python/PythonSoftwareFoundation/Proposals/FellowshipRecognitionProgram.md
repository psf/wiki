# PSF Fellow Recognition Program {#PSF_Fellow_Recognition_Program}

**Proposal editor:** Alyssa Coghlan

**Proposal status:** Superseded

This proposal was superseded by a proposal to formally amend the bylaws to permit Fellow nominations by any PSF Member, and to delegate the task of reviewing nominations to a chartered Working Group rather than requiring a ballot of all voting Members: [https://mail.python.org/pipermail/psf-community/2016-November/000398.html](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/psf-community/2016-November/000398.html){.https}

That resolution was passed as part of the 2017 PSF Board elections, and more information on the PSF Fellow working group can be found here: [https://wiki.python.org/psf/FellowWG](https://wiki.python.org/psf/FellowWG){.https}

All PSF Members are now able to submit new PSF Fellow nominations, as described in [https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/){.https}

The current list of fellows can be seen at [https://www.python.org/psf/members/#fellows](https://www.python.org/psf/members/#fellows){.https}, while previously submitted nominations can be seen at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/FellowNominations](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/FellowNominations){.https}
