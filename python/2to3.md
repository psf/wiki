# 2to3

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
**2to3** is a tool that automatically translates [2.x code to 3.x code](PortingPythonToPy3k).

## Description {#Description}

Overview: [Fun with 2to3](http://pybites.blogspot.com/2008/09/fun-with-2to3.html){.http} by Benjamin Peterson\

## Code {#Code}

The code is located at [http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/2to3](http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/2to3){.http}. At the moment, it is principally maintained by [BenjaminPeterson](BenjaminPeterson). Since Python 2.6, it has been included in the standard library.

## Ideas {#Ideas}

- Some people have expressed interest in adding directives in the source to 2to3. So you could write:

       # 2to3: strings-are-bytes
       x = "hi"
       # 2to3: end

  and that would get translated to

  `x = b"hi"`

- Last year there was a project to add confidence rankings to 2to3 changes. People could configure them to a certain level and deal with low confidence refactoring manually (or interactively). For some reason, the project was never finished. If you want to find more out about that, I suggest you contact [the student](http://isnomore.net/2to3){.http} or his mentor, Collin Winter.

- Some people have expressed an interest in seeing a 3to2 tool which would make 3.x code valid for \~2.5. Work is in progress, see [3to2](3to2)
