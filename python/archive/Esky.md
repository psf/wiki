[PyPi](./PyPi.html) entry: [keep frozen apps fresh](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/esky/0.9.0)

Esky is an auto-update framework for frozen Python applications. It provides a simple API through which apps can find, fetch and install updates, and a bootstrapping mechanism that keeps the app safe in the face of failed or partial updates.

Esky is currently capable of freezing apps with py2exe, py2app, cxfreeze and bbfreeze.
