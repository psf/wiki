At the end of 2013/beginning of 2014, a survey was conducted to see how much 3.x is catching on.

The survey was publicized via posts to [comp.lang.python](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2013-December/663539.html), [python-dev](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-December/130834.html) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6990481).

You can find the results here in PDF format: [2013-2014 Python 2.x-3.x survey.pdf](attachments/2(2e)x(2d)vs(2d)3(2e)x(2d)survey/2013-2014%20Python%202.x-3.x%20survey.pdf).

[Results are also available as a single chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq1sLIA-T44zdEhYdkQ3WVlhSnVRX2tobjVoRFdpTlE&gid=2). Unfortunately, you need to mouse over the labels to see the full question text.
