[ActiveState](ActiveState) seems to have the python snippet market well served [(example.)](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/334696) Its unfortunate they beat the python community to it, now they have a pretty big market share. \-- anon

I think they are \*part\* of the Python community, and they\'re doing a good job hosting the Cookbook. \-- [JeanJordaan](./JeanJordaan.html)

Can we successfully encourage new contributions to come to this wiki instead? Do we want that? \-- anon

Why? Don\'t do the same job again. Rather add value, e.g. by coordinating editors who rate and edit recipes at the ASPN cookbook. \-- [JeanJordaan](./JeanJordaan.html)

Can (legally/technically)/should we mine the content from [ActiveState](ActiveState) to seed this wiki? \-- anon

I don\'t think we should try to move it. They do an excellent job as far as I can tell. Why not let the community grow rather than try to restrict it? \-- anon

- I don\'t think we can mine the [ActiveStateCookbook](./ActiveStateCookbook.html) to seed the wiki.

- I will put all of my code snippets here.

Advantages of wiki over the [ActiveStateCookbook](./ActiveStateCookbook.html):

- wiki [affords](http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/WhatIsAffordance) linking between pages

- we can correct each others\' mistakes, without working through an editor

- we can organize each others\' contributions

I believe our situation is this:

- Many people want to put snippets on the [ActiveStateCookbook](./ActiveStateCookbook.html).

- Many people want to put snippets on this wiki.

*The Sum is Less than Parts.* \-- anon

I think the [PythonInfoWiki](PythonInfoWiki) isn\'t living up to it\'s potential. As far as I can tell, we are fragmentary, and nobody seems committed to the wiki. We don\'t even know who runs it. \-- [LionKimbro](LionKimbro) 2006-03-30 16:19:29
