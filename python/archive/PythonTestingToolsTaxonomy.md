  **Tool**                                                                **Category**          **Author**                                                                          **Part of**                                                                                                           **Claim to fame**
  [unittest](http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html)            unit testing          [Steve Purcell](http://www.pythonconsulting.com/)                            [Python standard lib](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html)                                         first unit test framework to be included in Python standard library; easy to use by people familiar with the xUnit frameworks; strong support for test organization and reuse via test suites
  [doctest](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html)           unit testing          [Tim Peters](http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0020.html)                       [Python standard lib](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html)                                             copy and paste output from shell session; [Agile Documentation](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/02/agile-documentation-with-doctest-and.html): unit tests themselves can serve as documentation when combined with epydoc; also see [Django\'s approach](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/08/agile-documentation-in-django-project.html)
  [pytest](http://pytest.org/en/latest/)                           unit testing          [Holger Krekel](http://holgerkrekel.net/about-me/)                           It used to be named py.test which was part of the [pylib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py). Standalone now.   no API!;automatic collection of tests; simple asserts; strong support for test fixture/state management via setup/teardown hooks; strong debugging support via customized traceback
  [nose](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/1.3.7)                 unittest extensions   [Jason Pellerin](http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/)                                                                                                                                             unit test framework, used most notably by [TurboGears](http://www.turbogears.org/) and [Pylons](http://pylonshq.com/); provides an alternate test discovery and running process for unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as much as is reasonably possible without resorting to too much magic. More friendly with unittest.[TestCase](./TestCase.html)-based tests than py.test. There are also many [plugins](http://nose-plugins.jottit.com/) available.
  [testify](https://github.com/Yelp/Testify/)                     unittest extensions   [Yelp team](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2010/10/now-testify.html#more)                                                                                                                         unit test framework, provides Enhanced test fixture setup, Split test suites into buckets for easy parallelization, PEP8 naming conventions & Fancy color test runner with lots of logging / reporting option.
  [Trial](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedTrial)         unittest extensions   [Jonathan Lange](http://mumak.net/)                                          [Twisted](http://www.twistedmatrix.com/)                                                                       Extension of unittest to support writing asynchronous unit tests using Deferreds and new result types (\'skip\' and \'todo\'). Includes a command-line program that does test discovery and integrates with doctest and coverage.
  [subunit](https://launchpad.net/subunit)                        unittest extensions   [Robert Collins](https://launchpad.net/~lifeless)                                                                                                                                                 Transparently adds support for running unittest test cases/suites in a separate process : prevents system wide changes by a test destabilising the test runner. It also allows reporting from tests in another process into the unittest framework, giving a single integrated test environment.
  [testresources](https://launchpad.net/testresources)            unittest extensions   [Robert Collins](https://launchpad.net/~lifeless)                                                                                                                                                 Provides a mechanism for managing \'resources\' - expensive bits of infrastructure - that are needed by multiple tests. Resources are constructed and free on demand, but with an optional [TestSuite?](http://pycheesecake.org/wiki/TestSuite), the test run order is optimised to reduce the number of resource constructions and releases needed. Compatible with unittest.
  [reahl.tofu](https://www.reahl.org/project?name=tofu)           unit testing          [Iwan Vosloo](https://www.reahl.org)                                                                                                                                                              Provides class based test Fixtures, in which several (usually interrelated) objects that need to be set up for tests are lumped together on a single object, called a Fixture. Fixtures are reusable and can depend on other Fixtures in turn. Fixtures can be used with any test framework, but easy integration is provided for pytest. A few other test utilities are included as well.
  [testtools](https://launchpad.net/testtools)                    unittest extensions   [Jonathan Lange](http://mumak.net/wiki)                                                                                                                                                            Useful extensions to unittest derived from custom extensions by projects such as Twisted and Bazaar.
  [Sancho](http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/DurusWorks/)      unit testing          [MEMS and Nanotechnology Exchange](http://www.mems-exchange.org/)            [MEMS Exchange tools](http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/)                                                  Sancho 2.1 runs tests, and provides output for tests that fail; Sancho 2.1 does not count tests passed or failed; targets projects that do not maintain failing tests
  [zope.testing](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zope.testing)   unit testing          Zope3 community                                                                                                                                                                                           Powerful test runner that includes support for post-mortem debugging of test failures. Also includes profiling and coverage reporting. This is a standalone package that has no dependencies on Zope and works just fine with projects that don\'t use Zope.
  [pry](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pry)                           unit testing          [Aldo Cortesi](http://corte.si/)                                                                                                                                                                   Elegant unit testing framework with built-in coverage analysis, profiling, micro-benchmarking and a powerful command-line interface.
  [pythoscope](http://pythoscope.org/)                             unit testing          [Michal Kwiatkowski](http://joker.linuxstuff.pl/)                                                                                                                                                  Tool that will automatically, or semi-automatically, generate unit tests for legacy systems written in Python.
  [testlib](http://www.logilab.org/project/logilab-common/)        unittest extensions   [Logilab](http://www.logilab.fr/)                                            logilab-common                                                                                                        Gives more power to standard unittest. More assert\* methods; support for module level setup/teardown; skip test feature\...
  [pytest](http://www.logilab.org/project/logilab-common/)         tests runner          [Logilab](http://www.logilab.fr/)                                            logilab-common                                                                                                        Tests finder / runner. Selectivly run tests; Stop on first failure; Run pdb on failed tests; Colorized reports; Run tests with coverage / profile enabled\...
  [dutest](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dutest)                     unittest extensions   [Olemis Lang](http://simelo-en.blogspot.com/)                                [PyOOP package](http://flioops.sf.net/) (distributed separately too)                                           An object oriented interface to retrieve unittest test cases out of doctests. Hides initialization from doctests by allowing setUp and tearDown for each interactive example. Allows control over all the options provided by doctest. Specialized classes allow selective test discovery across a package hierarchy.

  [TestOOB](http://testoob.sourceforge.net/)                 2009                unittest extensions                [Ori Peleg](http://freshmeat.net/~oripel/)            unittest enhancements; test filtering via regex/glob patterns; reporting in XML/HTML; colorized output; runs pdb on failing tests; run in parallel in threads/processes; verbose asserts; report failures immediately; and a little more;
  [pyUnitPerf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyunitperf)   2009                performance-based unit testing     [Grig Gheorghiu](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/)   port of [JUnitPerf](http://www.clarkware.com/software/JUnitPerf.html); transparently adds [performance testing capabilities](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2004/12/performance-testing-with-pyunitperf.html) to existing unitttest-based test suites
  [Peckcheck](https://github.com/darius/peckcheck)          2008                specification-based unit testing   [Darius Bacon](http://wry.me/blog/)                   like the unittest module, except that test methods may take arguments; you declare each argument with a default value which names a test-data generator and the peckcheck module will peck at your test methods with a bunch of generated values
  [testosterone](http://code.google.com/p/testosterone/)     2008                unit testing                       [Chad Whitacre](http://www.zetadev.com/)              A manly test runner; command-line and curses(3) interfaces; the iPod of test runners. (More seriously, makes it easier to browse and inspect your test failures)
  [qunittest](http://freshmeat.net/projects/qunittest/)      2004                unit testing                       [Edgewall](http://www.edgewall.com/)                  Easy-to-use ([PyQt](PyQt)) GUI framework and application for use with the Python unit testing framework. It can be used to conveniently execute unit tests and suites, and then display the results in a useful fashion.

  [Ludibrio](http://github.com/nsigustavo/ludibrio/)                             mocks, stubs, spy, and dummies             Gustavo Rezende                                                                              Elegant test doubles framework in Python (mocks, stubs, spy, and dummies)
  [Python Mock](http://python-mock.sourceforge.net/)                             mock testing                               [Dave Kirby](http://www.thedeveloperscoach.com/)                                      Python Mock enables the easy creation of mock objects that can be used to emulate the behaviour of any class that the code under test depends on. You can set up expectations about the calls that are made to the mock object, and examine the history of calls made. This makes it easier to unit test classes in isolation. [Download it here.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-mock/)
  [PyMock](http://theblobshop.com/pymock)                                        mock testing                               [Jeff Younker](http://theblobshop.com/)                                               [PyMock](./PyMock.html) is based on the Java [easymock](http://www.easymock.org/) package. It uses a recording and replay model rather than using a specification language. Easymock lives up to its name compared to other mocking packages. [PyMock](./PyMock.html) takes advantage of python\'s dynamic nature for futher improvements.
  [mock](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock.html)                           mock testing                               Michael Foord aka [Fuzzyman](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml)   Provides \"action -\> assertion\" mocking patter, instead of standard \"record -\> replay\" pattern
  [pMock](http://pmock.sourceforge.net/)                                         mock testing                               Graham Carlyle                                                                               Inspired by the Java [jMock](http://www.jmock.org/) library, pMock makes the writing of unit tests using mock object techniques easier. Development of pmock has long since stopped and so it can be considered dead.
  [minimock](http://blog.ianbicking.org/minimock.html)                           mock testing                               [Ian Bicking](http://blog.ianbicking.org/)                                            Embeds mock testing constructs inside doctest tests.
  [svnmock](http://oakwinter.com/code/svnmock/)                                  mock testing                               [Collin Winter](http://oakwinter.com/code/)                                           enables easier testing of Python programs that make use of [Subversion\'s](http://subversion.tigris.org/) Python bindings
  [Mocker](http://labix.org/mocker)                                              mock testing                               [Gustavo Niemeyer](http://blog.labix.org/)                                            Graceful platform for test doubles in Python (mocks, stubs, fakes, and dummies). Well-documented and fairly feature-complete.
  [Stubble](https://www.reahl.org/project?name=stubble)                         stub testing                               [Iwan Vosloo](https://www.reahl.org/)                                                Stubble allows you to write arbitrary classes for use as stubs instead of read classes while testing. Stubble lets you link a stub class loosely to the real class which it is a stub for. This information is then used to ensure that tests will break if there is a discrepancy between the interface supported by your stub class and that of the real class it stands in for.
  [Mox](http://code.google.com/p/pymox/)                                         mock testing                               smiddlek, dglasser                                                                           Mox is based on [EasyMock](./EasyMock.html), a Java mock object framework. Mox will make mock objects for you, so you don\'t have to create your own! It mocks the public/protected interfaces of Python objects. You set up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific language (DSL), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor!

Expectations are very readable and expressive, and checked automatically. Any stubbed methods are reverted after each test case. Still under development, so subject to change

## Fuzz Testing Tools 

According to Wikipedia, [\"fuzz testing\" (or \"fuzzing\")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) is a software testing technique whose basic idea is to attach the inputs of a program to a source of random data (\"fuzz\"). If the program fails (for example, by crashing, or by failing built-in code assertions), then there are defects to correct. The great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior.

## Web Testing Tools 

First, let\'s define some categories of Web testing tools:

- **Browser simulation** tools: simulate browsers by implementing the HTTP request/response protocol and by parsing the resulting HTML

- **Browser automation** tools: automate browsers by driving them for example via COM calls in the case of Internet Explorer, or XPCOM in the case of Mozilla

- **In-process** or unit-test-type tools: call an application in the same process, instead of generating an HTTP request; so an exception in the application would go all the way up to the command runner (py.test, unittest, etc).

It has an easy-to-use tabular syntax for creating test cases and its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java (requires Jython). Users can also create new keywords from existing ones using the same simple syntax that is used for creating test cases.

By automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each time something has changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly, before other developers are inconvenienced by the failure.
  [Bitten](http://bitten.edgewall.org/)                         [Christopher Lenz](http://cmlenz.net/)                                Bitten is a Python-based framework for collecting various software metrics via continuous integration. It builds on [Trac](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac) to provide an integrated web-based user interface.
  [SVNChecker](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/svnchecker/)   Heinrich Wendel of [German Aerospace Center](http://www.dlr.de/sc/)   SVNChecker is a framework for Subversion pre-commit hooks in order to implement checks of the to be commited files before they are commited. For example, you can check for the code style or unit tests. The output of the checks can be send by mail or be written into a file or simply print to the console.
  [apycot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apycot)                [Logilab](http://www.logilab.fr/)                                     an Automated Pythonic Code Tester: designed to run tests on a code repository on a daily basis. It comes with a set of predefined test, essentially for python packages, and a set of predefined reports to display execution results. However, it has been designed to be higly extensible, so you could write your own test or report using the Python language
  [pony-build](http://github.com/ctb/pony-build)                [Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/)                           pony-build is a simple continuous integration package that lets you run a server to display client build results. It consists of two components, a server (which is run in some central & accessible location), and one or more clients (which must be able to contact the server via HTTP). Philosophy statement: good development tools for Python should be easy to install, easy to hack, and not overly constraining. Two out of three ain\'t bad ;).
  [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)                      [Holger Krekel](http://holgerkrekel.net/about-me/)                    Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool. You can use it to check that your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters, to configure your test tool of choice and to act as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers. Documentation and examples [here](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#).
  [KREM](https://github.com/Bitvis/krem)                       [Bitvis](http://bitvis.no)                                            KREM is a very lightweight automation framework. KREM is also suitable for testing. KREM runs jobs made up of tasks executed in sequence, in parallel or a combination of both.
