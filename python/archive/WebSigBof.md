A BoF to talk about things that have come up on the Web-SIG list, or for that matter anything related to the Web SIG \"mission\".

[Web-SIG page](./(5b)http(3a2f2f)www(2e)python(2e)org(2f)sigs(2f)web(2d)sig(2f).html)\]

Maybe that would cover anyone using Python on the web?

Specific possible topics of discussion:

- The Web Container Interface specification as proposed on the list
- HTTP Request and Response objects
- Why we aren\'t really getting anything done on the Web-SIG list
- Unifying frameworks
- Layering frameworks
- Whatever
