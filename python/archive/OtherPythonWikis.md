I recommend the [WikiNode](./WikiNode.html) as a way of discovering connections between wiki. I\'ve been working on the concept for a while, but could still use a lot of help.

The best way to understand it, is to just traverse the local [WikiNodesNetwork,](http://wikinodes.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/WikiNodesNetwork) starting with our own [WikiNode](./WikiNode.html). Walk around a bit, and see what it\'s like.

To get into the nuts and bolts of it, visit the [WikiNodes wiki.](http://wikinodes.wiki.taoriver.net/)

# Thinki salvage 

Thinki [http://thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/](http://thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/) used to be a second major python wiki, similar in scope to wiki.python.org.

It appears to be gone. The Internet Archive last [captured](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/) the homepage on [Dec 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218211846/http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/), spammed. The previous [Oct 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011181006/http://thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/) homepage capture looks intact.

TODO: wiki.python.org has several now broken links to Thinki pages. These could be repointed at the IA captures. Or the Thinki interwiki link could be repointed, so `Thinki:UsingPythonWithOtherLanguages` would expand to [UsingPythonWithOtherLanguages](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/UsingPythonWithOtherLanguages) instead of [UsingPythonWithOtherLanguages](http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/UsingPythonWithOtherLanguages "Thinki") (404).

TODO: Thinki had a lot of content, not all of which seems to have ever made it into wiki.python.org. The IA captures provide an opportunity to copy information into wiki.python.org. To keep track of incremental progress, you might add notes below as you look around, evaluate pages, and pull content across.

- Pages are captured asynchronously - a 2004 page A may link to a 2003 page B, despite a 2005 page B existing. So edit the url, changing the date to /\*/, to see the available page captures.

- [http://web.archive.org/web/\*/http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/) Homepage.

  - [Oct 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011181006/http://thinkware.se/cgi-bin/thinki.cgi/) looks intact.
