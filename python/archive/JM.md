Hello! My name is JM and I am a Python programmer. Welcome to my Wiki page. Although I am new to the Python programming language, I still know how to do simple things using it. It have written several programs that create I/O interfaces for functions of the math module. I have been programming for just a couple of years know and am still learning. I hope to be able to interact with professional programmers through the Python Wiki.

Here are links to some of the programs that I have written:
