Someone asked about Python-related humor, and in particular community in-jokes for use in easter eggs. There is an [officialish page](http://www.python.org/doc/humor/) on the topic, but I thought it wouldn\'t be a bad wiki page topic.

Not so much a joke, but definitely a quirk known by the \"in\" crowd, The Zen of Python:

    Uche-Ogbujis-MacBook-Pro-2:caramusis uche$ python
    Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
