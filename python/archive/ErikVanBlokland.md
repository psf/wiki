# Hello 

Erik Van Blokland is a Dutch type designer. Started the [../LettError](./LettError.html) virtual type foundry with [JustVanRossum](JustVanRossum), with whom he worked at [Meta Design](http://www.metadesign.com/). Have a look at [http://www.letterror.com](http://www.letterror.com) for some of their exploits.

Fame came with the release of Beowolf (co-designed with [JustVanRossum](JustVanRossum)), a font whose ragged edges shift randomly each time you print the font. Another font of his, Kosmik, has a version that flips between three alternates for each character for a more friendly, hand-drawn feel. Most of his fonts are published by [FontFont](http://www.fontfont.com/). He is a key developer on the [../RoboFog](./RoboFog.html) project with [JustVanRossum](JustVanRossum) and [PetrVanBlokland](./PetrVanBlokland.html).\
