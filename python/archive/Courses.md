Specifically, the course will:

• Take you from a basic level of statistical knowledge to a level where you can perform some of the most common advanced regression analysis-based techniques

• Equip you to use Python to perform various statistical and machine learning data analysis tasks

• Introduce you in a hands-on way to some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts, so you can apply them to practical data analysis and interpretation

You will get a strong background in some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts and their applications in regression analysis. You will be able to decide which regression analysis techniques are best suited for answering your research questions and most applicable to your data; then you\'ll interpret the results.

This is a practical, hands-on course---we spend time dealing with some theoretical concepts related to both statistical and machine learning regression analysis.

Learn to use Python for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

Assume your target is running unpatched Windows XP, Anti-Virus is disabled, the firewall is turned off, IPS is not in place then you may (or not) get into a system! Does that sound like a real-world penetration test for you?

If you have ever attended an ethical hacking course that teaches you how to use some tools and how to click on some buttons, then you probably already know that being an advanced hacker needs more knowledge than clicking a few buttons as most of these tools will fail in a real-world scenario.

Whether you get bored from theory and basic courses which repeat the same tools and techniques over and over again and fail to teach you how to hack into even insecure systems, or you want to push your skills from beginner to the next level, then you have come to the right place!

There are quite a lot of people who call themselves hackers but, few have the solid skills to fit the definition, when other\'s tools fail, writing your own makes you a true hacker.

**Video Overview:**

Bring your Python skills into the real world. Solve production issues around databases, parallelism, and deployment

Python is simple, but it isn\'t easy. Python emphasizes code readability, using indentation and whitespaces to create code blocks. This makes it simpler than C++ or Java, where curly braces and keywords are scattered across the code. Python is high-level, which allows programmers like you to create logic with fewer lines of code.

This course follows a problem-solution format to tackle common roadblocks in Python programming. How can we handle large datasets and files, processing them in Python efficiently? How can we address performance issues for long-running tasks?

**Video Overview:**

Build high-performance, distributed, and parallel applications in Dask

Data analysts, Machine Learning professionals, and data scientists often use tools such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and [NumPy](NumPy) for data analysis on their personal computer. However, when they want to apply their analyses to larger datasets, these tools fail to scale beyond a single machine, and so the analyst is forced to rewrite their computation.

In this course, you'll learn to scale your data analysis. Firstly, you will execute distributed data science projects right from data ingestion to data manipulation and visualization using Dask. Then, you will explore the Dask framework. After, see how Dask can be used with other common Python tools such as [NumPy](NumPy), Pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more.

Learn to visualize your data using Python in this data science course

Data is becoming a force to reckon with. With the amount of data that is being generated every minute, dealing with data has become more important. The importance of data lies in the fact that it allows us to look at our history and predict the future. Data science is the field that deals with collecting, sorting, organizing and also analyzing huge amounts of data. This data is then used to understand the current and future trends. This field borrows techniques and theories from across multiple fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, etc. It also aids other domains such as machine learning, data mining, databases and visualization. Data scientists are gaining importance and are also earning higher salaries, which means this is the right time to become a data scientist. While, it might seem easy, sorting data, these scientists are responsible for writing important algorithms and programs to help sort and analyze the data -- and this isn't an easy task.

The course will cover a number of different concepts such as an introduction to data science including concepts such as linear algebra, probability and statistics, Matplotlib, charts and graphs, data analysis, visualization of non uniform data, hypothesis and gradient descent, data clustering and so much more. That's not all, we'll also include projects to help you show exactly how to build visuals using Python. You can learn all this and tons of interesting stuff in this unique data science course. Enroll now and start building next generation interfaces for your data.

[Data Science and Machine Learning with Python - Hands On!](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/data-science-and-machine-learning-python-hands-video) \[Video\]

By Frank Kane

ISBN 13: 9781787127081 Packt Publishing Video length 8 hour 50 minutes (September 2016)

**Video Overview:**

This video will help you take your first steps in the world of data science, and empower you to conduct data analysis and perform efficient machine learning using Python. Gain value from your data using the various data mining and data analysis techniques in Python, and develop efficient predictive models to predict future results. You will also learn how to perform large-scale machine learning on Big Data using Apache Spark. You don't have to be an expert coder in Python to get the most out of this video -- just a basic programming knowledge of Python is sufficient.

- Learn how to clean your data and ready it for analysis
- Implement the popular clustering and regression methods in Python
- Train efficient machine learning models using Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Visualize the results of your analysis using Python's Matplotlib library

**Who this video is for:**

If you are a budding data scientist or a data analyst who wants to analyze and gain actionable insights from data using Python, this video is for you. Programmers with some experience in Python who want to enter the lucrative world of Data Science will also find this video to be very useful.

[Beginning Python (Video)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-python-video)

William Fiset

ISBN: 9781786468994

Course Length: 4 hours and 20 minutes, April 2016, Packt Publishing

This course assumes no programming experience and slowly builds the tools you need to take on larger challenges. Once this is done, dive into the fundamentals of Python programming with variables, numbers, strings, and so on. You\'ll learn to make decisions on your programs with conditional statements and discover that Python has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence such as a list or a string with loops.

You will see how functions play a major role to provide a high degree of code reusing. Along with the built-in functions, you will be able to build your own functions as well. When you\'ve done all this, you\'ll be ready to create modules in Python all by yourself. Finally, you\'ll enhance your skills by performing some very interesting manipulations on images.

**What You Will Learn**:

- Get to know Python's data structures to enhance good design patterns and scalability to your code
- Construct loops to perform repeated tasks
- Create functions in Python to provide programs with better modularity
- Understand the concept of function recursion adding clarity to write and debug codes
- Manage program control flow and branching to perform conditional tasks
- Install third-party libraries to add advanced customizations to images

The viewer will know the basics of what programming languages are, but won't need any knowledge of Python. Nor will the need any actual hands-on experience in a specific language.
