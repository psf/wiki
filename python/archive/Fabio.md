I\'m a 31 years old System Analyst, playing this role since 1998. I\'ve been working with POO since 1996, OOAD and UML since 2001. Nowadays I\'m working with .NET framework, maintaining and developing solutions for Private Retirement and life insurance market.

I read some articles about python and got interested to known about it.

After navigating through the oficial website and this wiki I want to learn this programming language.
