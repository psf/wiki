# Python Lore and Cultural Info 

This page is a collection point for various insider knowledge of the Python community, for compilation into a short, hopefully entertaining screencast for introducing people to the way things happen.

## Terminology 

Part of that is knowing the terms you often hear on the lists, both what it stands for *and* what it means. I\'ve heard these used as insider comments at past [PyCons](./PyCons.html), with newbies shaking their heads not understanding:

- [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It) (you ain\'t gonna need it; yet another great new interface)

- DRY (don\'t repeat yourself)

- TSTTCPW (the simplest thing that could possibly work)

- (drat - at some previous [PyCon](PyCon) someone put up list of such

  - acronyms, and I can\'t remember them)

## Insider Jokes 

- Guido\'s time machine

- \"import this\"

- \"from [future] import braces\"
