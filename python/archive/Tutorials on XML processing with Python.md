Dive into Python 3, chapter on XML processing: [https://www.cmi.ac.in/\~madhavan/courses/prog2-2012/docs/diveintopython3/xml.html](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/prog2-2012/docs/diveintopython3/xml.html)

# DOM/SAX: 

*Start here if you need to maintain existing DOM/SAX code that uses the `xml.dom`{.backtick} and `xml.sax`{.backtick} packages, or want to process XML using these packages*

**Note**: some of these also describe the use of PyXML, which is an outdated XML package that is no longer maintained and should not be used in new code.
