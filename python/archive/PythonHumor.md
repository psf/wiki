# PythonHumor

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

So! There\'s a /doc/humor page at [http://www.python.org/doc/humor/](http://www.python.org/doc/humor/) that tells you to put suggestions for additions on a wiki page that does not exist (wiki.python.org/PythonHumor is where it links to).

Since that doesn\'t exist, I\'ve created this page to suggest my all-time favorite CLP posting for inclusion: [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/7613422265cdc010](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/7613422265cdc010) .
