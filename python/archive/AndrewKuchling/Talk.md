Andrew,

Apologies for mishandling the misplaced question on [BeginnersGuide/Overview](./BeginnersGuide(2f)Overview.html). I agree that\'s not the right place for Q&A, but I was trying to answer the anonymous question in a way the author might find the answer without having to be wiki-literate.

Unfortunately, it took me some time to understand your comment: \"Question answered by doc/faq/installed.txt.\" Apparently this refers to [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/installed.html](http://www.python.org/doc/faq/installed.html), with a .html extension. Admittedly I\'m not a Python guru, but if I took several minutes to understand this comment, the original author of the question might have just given up (presuming \[s\]he saw the comment at all, which presumes enough wiki-familiarity to check the history to figure out why the question was deleted!).

I\'m 100% for putting everything in its place; I\'m just not sure that a wiki-inexperienced person with this question would be able to find the answer given your response. So if the wiki isn\'t partially intended to help newbie end-users find answers to their questions, maybe I don\'t understand the purpose of the wiki very well.

(And sorry if this isn\'t the way to do a \"Talk\" page. I\'m new to moin. Please teach me if there\'s a better way.)

Cheers, [Philip](Philip) - 2005-09-21
