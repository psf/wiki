# Distributed Objects for Python 

DOPY is a small distributed object system written entirely in Python. It is not intended to be CORBA compliant. Instead, it aims to be extremely easy to use and to support Python\'s dynamic nature - methods are invoked dynamically, parameters are passed by reference. Any python object that can be pickled can automatically be passed as a parameter or a return value, and any Python object can be published as a shelved object.

It\'s good to mention [CORBA](./CORBA.html). Someone needs to compare [Pyro](Pyro) with DOPY.
