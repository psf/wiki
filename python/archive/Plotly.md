# Overview 

[Plotly](https://plotly/) is a collaborative, web-based graphing and analytics platform.

### Plotting Library and Web App 

[Plotly](https://plot.ly/) allows users to import, copy and paste, or stream data to be analyzed and visualized. For analysis and styling graphs, Plotly offers a Python sandbox ([NumPy](NumPy) supported), datagrid, and GUI. Python scripts can be saved, shared, and collaboratively edited in Plotly.

The [Plotly Python graphing library](https://plot.ly/api/python/) is a scientific graphing library. Graphs can be styled with Python and a GUI, and shared with a URL for others to view, collaborate, or save a copy.

### Installation 

Users can install and sign up for Plotly from the terminal. See [documentation](https://plot.ly/api/python) for walk-through and sign-up steps: [https://plot.ly/api/python](https://plot.ly/api/python).

      $ pip install plotly

or

      $ easy_install plotly

### Using Plotly and IPython 

Plotly also integrates with IPython to create interactive graphs in a Notebook. A few examples are available in [the gallery](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/IPython-plotly/tree/master/) that show how to use LaTeX, [GapMinder](./GapMinder.html) bubble charts, [NumPy](NumPy), pandas, datetime, and MATLAB in IPython.
