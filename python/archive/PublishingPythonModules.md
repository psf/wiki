# Publishing Python Code 

## Distributing projects 

[The Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) (aka \"PyPI\" \-- formerly known as the \"Cheese Shop\") is the preferred hub for publishing Python packages and modules.

See the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/).

## Sharing code snippets 

The [Python section of the ActiveState Code Recipes](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/) is a popular place to publish small useful snippets of code.

Alternatively, you may add such snippets to this Wiki and link to them from the [Code](Code) page.

Your operating system distribution may have software collections. Searching for Python software can yield numerous packaged libraries and applications. For example:

- [Python packages in Debian stable](http://packages.debian.org/stable/python/) (see also the [Debian package search page](http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages))

- [Python packages in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS](http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/) (see also the [Ubuntu package search page](http://packages.ubuntu.com/))

## Outdated / inactive hosting sites for Python code 

- *Useless Python* was a site for indiscriminate publishing of all bits of Python code you didn\'t think were *worth* publishing. Now inactive and web address (`www.uselesspython.com`{.backtick}) used to place ads.

- *Vaults of Parnassus* - a former link store for Python modules. You had to host files elsewhere, but this was one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code. Now non-existent.

- *PyCode* - an older site where you could share modules. Site (`www.pycode.com`{.backtick}) now used for unrelated blogging.
