# Python Documentation 

## Current Python Documentation 

Python\'s documentation is found online at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/), including all current translations.

## Documentation for end-of-life Python releases 

Older versions of the standard documentation are kept available as well, since many users have to maintain code for older versions of the interpreter as well. These can be found at [https://www.python.org/doc/versions.html](https://www.python.org/doc/versions.html).

## Other learning resources 

[https://www.python.org/doc/](https://www.python.org/doc/) lists other resources, including books and alternative introductory material.
