# Asking for Help: No module named visual 

I had trouble running my program. I am following instructions from the Youtube video. This is the error I get.

    Python 2.7.1 (r271:86882M, Nov 30 2010, 09:39:13) 
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5494)] on darwin
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
    >>> ================================ RESTART ================================
    >>> 

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/PRousseau/Desktop/sphere.py", line 1, in <module>
        from visual import *
    ImportError: No module named visual
    >>> 

If you\'re referring to one of [these videos](http://www.youtube.com/vpythonvideos) then you need to install [VPython](http://vpython.org/) on your computer. It looks like you\'re using a Mac, so maybe [this download page](http://vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html) will be helpful.
