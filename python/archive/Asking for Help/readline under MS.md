readline under ms windows

First of all thanks for the Python. I think it\'s the most beautiful scripting language for today.

Actually I\'m a Linux user, and believe, that under Linux I won\'t have such problem, but for a while Linux is inaccessible for me.

I\'m writing little console application, and it would be great to have auto-completion feature. As I understood it could be made through readline module functions, but there is no readline under MS.

What can you suggest? (migration on linux isn\'t an option %)

Try asking on [python-list@python.org](mailto:python-list@python.org) or [help@python.org](mailto:help@python.org).

- Should we remove [AskingForHelp](./AskingForHelp.html) pages at all? Actually, there is Windows version of readline for IPython. \-- [techtonik](techtonik) 2011-04-02 18:35:26
