### 3D CAD/CAM 

- FreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on Open Cascade, Qt and Python. It features some key concepts like Macro recording, Workbenches, ability to run as a server and dynamically loadable Application extensions and its designed to be platform independent\... [http://free-cad.sourceforge.net/](http://free-cad.sourceforge.net/)

- Fandango is planned to be a full featured CAD program. It has a C++ core extensible by scripts. Currently the memory core for entity management is ready, scripting works wonderfully thanks to the ease of embedding and extending of Python. A KDE+XML user interface is now in place, controlling the keyboard and mouse. [http://www.soffernet.com/jaime/fandango/](http://www.soffernet.com/jaime/fandango/)

- PythonCAD is a CAD package written, surprisingly enough, in Python. The PythonCAD project aims to produce a scriptable, open-source, easy to use CAD package for Linux, the various flavors of BSD Unix, commercial Unix, and other platforms to which someone who is interested ports the program. Work began on PythonCAD in July, 2002, and the first public release was on December 21, 2002. In addition it has been ported to winXP [http://www.pythoncad.org/](http://www.pythoncad.org/)

- [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) is the free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License. It only uses Python as a scripting language, however.
