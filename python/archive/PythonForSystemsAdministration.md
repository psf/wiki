# Python for Systems Administration 

Python is used in numerous places for systems management and administration:

- Many GNU/Linux distributions use Python to manage resources and packages:
  - In many programs and components in the Ubuntu distributions (and related services): \"Ubuntu prefer the community to contribute work in Python.\" ([Ubuntu bounties for Python work](http://www.ubuntu.com/community/developerzone/bounties))

  - [Reconstructor](http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1) for Ubuntu and [Revisor](http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/) for Fedora - applications which let users customise their GNU/Linux distribution CDs - are both written in Python

  - Red Hat\'s up2date tool (the pulsating red dot)

  - [yum](http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/) provides software updates for Fedora and other distributions

  - [mock](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock) and [plague](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Plague) controls the building of the packages in the Fedora operating system

  - Fedora and Red Hat\'s installer, [Anaconda](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) (notice the clever python tie-in on the name).

  - Gentoo Linux *relies* on Python since the [Portage](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/) package management system is written in Python

  - Pardus uses Python extensively: [\"Python in Pardus\"](http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/comar/PythonInPardus.html)
- HP Compaq / IBM preinstalled Python on a series of computers for some administration tasks
