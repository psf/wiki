## The Winnipeg Python Users Group 

Welcome! We are about 60 [Python](http://www.python.org) users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We formed in 2005 and for 3+ years we met monthly to listen to a presentation, learn from each other\'s experience programming in Python, or occasionally work on a project together. Since February 2009 we have not been meeting as regularly. Time will tell if this means we\'re dormant, taking a break, or just functioning as a mailing list of Python users in Winnipeg. We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren\'t tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome. There is no charge to attend the meetings or join the group.

We encourage you to [join](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg) our **mailing list**. The traffic is low and it provides a point for connection to Winnipeg Python users for events, job offers, etc. There are [archives](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/winnipeg/).

### Meeting Times and Location 

Meetings have traditionally been held the fourth Wednesday of the month from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. downtown, but we may try alternating between downtown and the U of M.

For meetings at Epic, the address is 167 Sherbrook, parking on the street or in the lot at the back, website [http://Epic.ca](http://Epic.ca).
