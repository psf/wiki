# OSPP 

**OSPP** stands for Open-Source Python Project.

The OSPP is a small dedicated group of novice programmers with the aim to create programs and release the source so that people can view, edit, and release the programs without any credit needing to be given to the author.

Their database is currently small, yet it is growing each day.
