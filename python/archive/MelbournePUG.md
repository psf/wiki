Newcomers are always welcome to attend or write to the mailing list, we\'re a friendly bunch!

We have a policy about job offers on the mailing list:

- As long as it\'s a Python-related job offer by the hiring company and not by an intermediary recruiter, you can just send it to the mailing list.
- If it\'s not Python-related, or the poster of the job ad is a recruiter who won\'t mention the company that will be doing the hiring, please just use Seek or Monster, and don\'t write to the mailing list.

## Code of conduct 

Though we are not affiliated with Linux Australia or Pycon AU, we\'ve chosen to follow their [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linuxaustralia/constitution_and_policies/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) for our meetings. Not because we\'ve ever had any problem in the past, but so that we know what to do if any problem should arise in the future.

## Previous Meetings & Topics 

**Monday 2020-02-03, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. David Andersson: Recent developments in OpenAlchemy**

David will give an update on recent developments in his OpenAlchemy package (recently renamed), which automatically translates OpenAPI schemas to SQLAlchemy database models.

**2. Henry Walshaw: How fast is FastAPI?: continuing the grand tradition of random pet photos**

FastAPI is a Python web framework designed to make the creation of an API as simple as possible and to be as high performance as possible using ASGI (async service gateway interface - a "spiritual successor" to WSGI). Among its other claims FastAPI allows easy definition of an API, handing of data definitions through pydantic and Python's type annotations, automatic swagger documentation generation, takes advantage of asynchronous operations to reduce server load, and easy deployment on top of Uvicorn.

We'll put this to the test in creating a new API in the best traditions of the dog photo API to get back random photos from a trip to Melbourne Zoo. We'll take a look at how easy it is to write, what gotchas there might be, and see if we can load test it a bit to compare the performance to an equivalent Flask server.

**Monday 2019-12-02, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. Luke Clarke: Automating WordPress audit with Python**

Luke will present the Python-based tools he has used to navigate automatically through 20+ clients\' WordPress sites and gather their PHP version, WordPress version, plugin versions, whether there are plugin updates outstanding.

**2. Ed Schofield: First look at TensorFlow Probability**

Ed will give a brief introduction to Bayesian machine learning and a first look at the TensorFlow Probability library.

**Monday 2019-11-04, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. David Andersson: Reduce API Code Duplication with OpenAPI and SQLAlchemy**

In this talk David will introduce his OpenAPI-SQLAlchemy package, which seeks to use schemas from an OpenAPI specification to define the SQLAlchemy models. This reduces code duplication, automatically propagates database schema changes to the API specification and documentation and adds support for references and inheritance in SQLAlchemy models.

**2. Lolitha Ratnayake: What\'s New in Python 3.8**

Python 3.8 was released on 2019-10-14. We will be discussing what the major changes are and why you should care.

**Monday 2019-10-07, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. Juan Nunez-Iglesias: napari: a fast, n-dimensional image viewer in Python** (\~25 minutes)

Juan will give a demo of napari, an OpenGL and Qt-based viewer for nD arrays, with a focus on biology. By default, napari will render a 2D slice of an nD array and provide sliders for any additional dimensions, but with one click it can also render 3D and remove one of the sliders. Napari can overlay multiple volumes and layers of different types (images, points, shapes, \...), allowing annotation of nD images. Finally, napari is compatible with dask arrays, making it able to view enormous datasets that don\'t fit in RAM.

**2. Clinton Roy: Python packaging with Poetry** (\~30 minutes)

This talk aims to look at some of the ways Poetry moves the conversation forward, learns from other packaging ecosystems, and where Python itself is going.

We will be talking file formats, Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) to do with packaging, different packaging ideologies and looking at what we can learn from completely different languages.

We'll also be taking a look at the community's approach to finding the way forward.

**Monday 2019-09-02, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. Michael Milewski: Next-level test driven development with TCR** (\~15-20 minutes)

Developers love to write code but once the code is undergoing iterative development by a group of developers, testing the code is a must. A lot of developers under the Extreme Programming movement even choose to write their tests first in Test Driven Development, TDD. TCR, or \"test && commit \|\| revert\" is taking it to the next level. Not only do you write your tests first but if your test passes then the code will be committed and if it fails - deleted and you start again. A brief coding demo of writing code with no tests, the benefit of test driving code with TDD and finally seeing what we can learn from TCR.

**2. Genevieve Buckley: Recap of the 2019 [SciPy](SciPy) conference** (\~40 minutes)

This talk makes use of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Services. The same principles can be applied to any cloud provider or any in-house setup.

**2. Dilan Kalpa: Accessing Google Spreadsheet Data using Python**

When people need to build a CRUD app for internal use, most probably think of using a database like MySQL or MongoDb. But Google Docs as a backend (consumed via JSON) really does come in handy when it comes to handling internal app data.

In this presentation, Dilan is going to show you how to use the Gspresd Python package to read, write, and delete data from a Google Spreadsheet with just a few lines of code.

**Monday 2019-05-06, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. Ben Dechrai: \"Let\'s connect our front door to the internet! What could possibly go wrong?\"**

Securing IoT is hard, and the last thing we want to do is let some stranger in! Let\'s take a step back and consider other ways of securing that door, and granting access remotely, without connecting your door to the internet, while adhering to common protocols and data formats throughout. By mixing up a little Near Field Communication with JSON Web Tokens, sprinkling some Rich Communication Services and a fairly simple native mobile app, we should be able to create and demo an effective security process for letting the milkman in!

Join us on this interactive journey, and maybe when one door closes, another will, actually, open.

**2. Ned Letcher: \"Snek Wrangling: Python Installation and Package management with pyenv, pip-tools, and pipx\"**

Python\'s \"batteries included\" philosophy means it comes bundled with a rich standard library offering a powerful set of accelerators. When it comes to managing Python installations and project dependencies, however, the built-in tooling leaves something to be desired. Virtual environments are crucial for isolating your project dependencies, but they can be frustrating to work with without any supporting tooling. Python\'s \"pip\" package manager is great, but it does not provide a built-in means for defining and tracking project requirements separate from downstream dependencies. After some experimentation and a few projects later, it\'s all too easy to get yourself into a spaghetti-like mess of various Python installations that can step on each other\'s toes.

In this talk, Ned will describe a toolchain containing the packages pyenv, pip-tools, and pipx, that together help smooth over these challenges and remove friction from your Python development experience.

**Monday 2019-04-01, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**. Level 2, 17 Hardware Lane, Melbourne CBD

### Talks: 

**1. Michael Milewski: VI everywhere \-- what\'s your superpower**

Abstract: \"Once you learn VI bindings, they will be stuck with you for life \-- and you will want to use them everywhere. This is an exploration of all the places you can use them, from the command line, Python REPL, to your database console, browser and program input, even ways of adding them to places they don\'t exist. Even if VI has always been on your TODO list, some tips on how to get started in learning VI bindings from someone who is pragmatic and does NOT use VIM as their editor, just VI bindings in every place you would least expect.

### Talks: 

**1. Peter Degorski: Weather, Energy, and Python** (\~30 minutes)

\"Energy Analytics is a new industry which Victoria is well positioned to lead in. Python is one of the wonderful tools that are adaptable enough to keep up with the enormous fast paced change. Pvlib-python and windpowerlib are great open source python tools used to model and study utility scale modules and wind turbines. Both are highly customisable. These two renewable energy modelling packages can run stand-alone and with some effort can be adapted to run on historical weather datasets. Doing this can help with the analysis of correlations in the wind/solar generation portfolio of Victoria. Python was the perfect package for this type of project; in my case it was used end to end; from downloading of the data to data modelling, analysis and ultimately visualisation.\"

**2. Ed Schofield: Handling physical quantities and units with Python** (\~15 minutes)

Following on from Peter\'s talk, Ed will give an overview of the why and how of Python tools to handle units easily for scientific and engineering-heavy fields.

**Monday 2018-08-06, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**, at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

### Talks: 

**1. Damien George, Nick Moore, Matt Trentini: A Taste of MicroPython** (\~30 minutes)

### Talks: 

**1. Graeme Cross: From \"Glue it\" to \"Ship it\"** (\~25 minutes)

Python is an excellent language for rapidly prototyping ideas, and is very well suited to gluing together different tools, libraries and frameworks into a cohesive prototype. However this doesn\'t always map well into a robust production code base for an application that is shipped out to paying customers.

This presentation will cover a checklist of considerations to factor into your project before you dive into your prototype to help make life easier, budgets lower, schedules shorter, lawyers poorer and customers happier when your well-received prototype then has to be shipped.

**2. Mike Dewhirst: Chemical database scraping via Django Admin** (20 minutes)

This is a beginner- to intermediate-level walk-through of a real-world project that uses Django and specifically its Admin interface.

The Django Admin was originally billed as being \"production ready\" code but this was watered down in the Django docs a couple of years ago. Mike\'s SharedSDS project is in production and he will explain in this talk why he thinks the Admin is magnificent.

### Talks: 

**1. Robert Lechte: \"Your database migrations are bad.\"** (25-30 minutes)

It\'s really hard to work with database schemas. But schemas are actually good. The trouble is that people get frustrated with the tooling. Existing migration tools (alembig, django migrations etc.) all make it far too hard. Every change is a chore when you have to worry about version numbers and migration files each time. It\'s tedious, manual, error-prone, and hard to test.

Fortunately, we can do better! Using Python and PostgreSQL, we\'ll discuss a radically different approach to managing schema migrations, using new tools and workflows to make it much faster, mostly automatic, fully testable, and more reliable.\"

Bio: Robert created the data warehousing for New Zealand\'s supercomputing infrastructure, then worked for the Digital Transformation Agency in Sydney. He has been writing Python tools to make working with databases more pleasant.

**2. Fred Rotbart: Highlights from [PyCon](PyCon) Israel 2017** (15 minutes)

Python wasn\'t particularly popular in Israel until recently but has exploded in popularity in the last 1-2 years. Fred attended [PyCon](PyCon) Israel this year and was surprised at how large the community there is now. He will talk about the event, Python uptake in general, and give highlights from the event.

**3. Ed Schofield: publishing with Python** (25-30 minutes)

Python has long had Sphinx for generating high-quality technical documentation from reStructuredText (ReST). Many projects have more recently adopted one of many flavours of Markdown as a simple, flexible format, while Jupyter notebooks have taken the Python world by storm. This talk will give an overview of the impressive set of tools in R for publishing (knitr, Rmarkdown) and compare what the Python ecosystem has to offer.

**Monday 2017-10-02, 5:45pm for 6:00pm**, at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

Talks: 1. Renaldi Gondosubroto: \"Moving Ahead with Internet of Things Developments in Python\"

Abstract:

\"In this talk, I will discuss how the Internet of Things is applied in Python at the moment and how it has progressed so far. This will be complemented by examples through some of my own experiences in projects involving the concept. One example of the practice that I will show is its use is through libraries created via TCP / IP connections to generate data collected from devices placed in other locations - and in this practice - measure environmental parameters in the environment through the Raspberry Pi. From here I will also discuss how other third party IoT services such as Amazon Web Services or [ThingSpeak](./ThingSpeak.html) can also connect and manage smart devices from there, utilizing the MQTT protocol. Next I will talk more about how this is very useful from the point of view of consumers, and how the methodology of its use can be developed with code architecture in Python. After that, I will discuss the future of this IoT concept for Python, how I see this concept will grow on this platform, and future developments that can still be done at this time.\"
