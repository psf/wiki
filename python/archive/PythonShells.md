# Python Shells 

The term \"Python shell\" has a certain amount of ambiguity: for some people it may merely refer to an interactive Python environment with special capabilities (autocompletion, visualisation, and so on); for others it may refer to a replacement command environment for traditional UNIX shells (sh, csh, bash, etc.) where emphasis is placed on interaction with files and programs.

## Enhanced Python Environments 

- [IPython](IPython)

- [Reinteract](http://www.reinteract.org)

- [bpython](http://bpython-interpreter.org/)

## Traditional Shell Replacements 

See the [UsePythonAsAnInteractiveShell](UsePythonAsAnInteractiveShell) page for a discussion on using Python command environments as UNIX shell replacements.

- [CherryShell](./CherryShell.html) (a Python shell in a Web browser; currently version 0.1 but still useful for remote operations; designed to replace [PyroShell](./PyroShell.html), feature code completion and code tips; works right now only with Firefox)
