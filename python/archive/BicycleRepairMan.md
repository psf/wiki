The Python [RefactoringBrowser](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactoringBrowser "Wiki"), helping Pythonistas everywhere glide over the gory details of refactoring their code. Watch him extract jumbled code into well ordered classes. Gasp, as he renames all occurrences of a method. Thank You Bicycle Repair Man!

BicycleRepairMan has been designed to integrate easily with your favourite editor or IDE. Integration currently exists for Emacs/XEmacs, IDLE, Eric3 and Vim.

In addition to refactoring, BicycleRepairMan provides support for doing queries on your code - e.g. \'find all uses of this method\'.
