# Welcome to JAM\'s Wiki Page 

Hello! My name is JAM. I am rather new to the Python programming language, but I still can write some simple programs using it. I hope to learn more about the Python programming language through this Wiki.

I will try to support the Python programming language the best that I can. I have researched several programming languages and have found that Python is **very** flexible. I think that it is going to become very important as computers advance. With its communications modules, it could very well become a driving language behind the Information Super-Highway.

You can now email me at [jam555691@yahoo.com](mailto:jam555691@yahoo.com). You can also chat with me using your Yahoo! Instant messanger if I\'m online.
