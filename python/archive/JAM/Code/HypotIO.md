# HypotIO 

This program creates an I/O interface for the *hypot(x, y)* function of the math module. It is very simple.

# Code 

{{{from math import hypot

print \"HypotIO - Written by JAM in Python 2.4.1\" print print \"What is the value of x?\" x = float(raw_input()) print print \"What is the value of y?\" y = float(raw_input()) print print \"The value of z is:\" print hypot(x, y) print print \"Press Enter to quit.\" raw_input()}}}

# Download 

The download for this program is now available. It is attached as HypotIO.py.
