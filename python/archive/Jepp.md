Its [home page](http://jepp.sourceforge.net/) advertises Jepp as \"Java Embedded Python\". While that same home page rather mysteriously suggests that \"Java-based languages\" may be \"massive\[ly\]\" slower than [CPython](CPython), and likely to \"suddenly change widely-used features\", its characterizations of Jepp itself are not problematic: Jepp appears to handle threading reliably, for example.

Be careful to distinguish Jepp from [JPype](JPype).
