## Complete SSL support 

Add full SSL support to the socket module, especially support for running SSL servers.\
This module should provide comprehensive SSL/TLS support (client and server support, certificate handling, algorithm selection\...).

\.... Because three already existing modules to do this isn\'t enough yet? So we need yet another one? ***Say What?***. Please nobody do this\...

*People have requested better SSL support to be included in core Python. Perhaps one of the existing modules could be made acceptable for inclusion into the core. \--amk*
