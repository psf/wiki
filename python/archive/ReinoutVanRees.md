I\'m programming python and django (with lots of geo stuff) at [http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl](http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Before my current job I did the following python-related things:

\* I used to use python/zope/plone for my phd (+/- construction industry plus semantic web)

\* I made plone websites for [http://zestsoftware.nl](http://zestsoftware.nl)

\* I coded in grok for [http://www.thehealthagency.com](http://www.thehealthagency.com)

[http://reinout.vanrees.org/](http://reinout.vanrees.org/) is the best summary.

I\'ve attended more than half of all Europythons and I\'m a regular at the Dutch python usergroup meetings.
