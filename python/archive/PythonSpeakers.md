# Python needs speakers! 

Organizers of Python user groups and regional conferences need help finding speakers to pull together great events and grow the Python community. Help them find you!

If you\'re willing and able to speak on Python topics, please add yourself to the list below. This isn\'t a firm commitment to give a talk if you\'re asked, but allows organizers to contact you and negotiate terms. Please include at least the following information:

- Your name in first, last format. Several people have created personal wiki pages and linked to them.
- How to contact you: you may provide an e-mail address, your web site URL, a Twitter or Facebook URL, etc.
- Your geographical location. At a minimum give your country, but please consider providing your state/province and city.
- The geographical area you can appear in, if this is different from your location. For example, you may be able to give talks in a distant city that you visit regularly on business.
- Topics you can speak about, or activities you can lead.

Please put your information all on one line (even if it\'s a long line) - that helps people cut/paste it into spreadsheets and e-mails.
