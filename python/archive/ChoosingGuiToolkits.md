# ChoosingGuiToolkits

This page should help beginners decide which of the many libraries for [GuiProgramming](GuiProgramming) is best for their particular needs.

# Features 

## Widgets 

Which Widgets are available? In the base distribution? In additional libraries? Are the additional libraries portable as well?

## Portability 

On which platforms is the toolkit available? Is the code written for the toolkit really portable or does the application behave differently on some platforms?

## Ease of Installation 

Is it easy to install all the parts necessary? Is is easy to bundle the libraries with the application to allow for a single installer and no version dependencies?

## Integration into Desktop 

Does it look and behave like a native application? Is it possible to make use of special features of a specific platform (say: minimize to tray on Windows)?

# Learnability 

## Newbie Documentation 

What documentation is there to learn the toolkit? Demos, tutorials, books etc. Are GUI builders available?

## Reference Documentation 

Most toolkits are written for a different language. Is there Python specific documentation available? If not, is it easy to translate the documentation to the Python view?

## Demo Applications 

Are there any real application written for this toolkit to show off advanced features?

# Limits 

Is it possible to write your own widgets in 100% Python? How\'s the future of the toolkit? How easy is it to build all the parts from scratch if no one updates the binaries? Is this true for all platforms?

# Licence 

GPL, BSD like, commercial, on all platforms?

# Other
