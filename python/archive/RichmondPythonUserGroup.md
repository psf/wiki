# PyRVA 

PyRVA is the new Richmond Python User Group founded on 1 September 2015. At the moment, we are using [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/PyRVA-Meetup/), but are in the process of developing [PyRVA.org](http://www.pyrva.org).

## Meetups 

We hope to schedule one or more small meetups in Fall 2015, but are targeting Winter 2016 for our full events. Our event ideas include talks, hackathons and workshops.
