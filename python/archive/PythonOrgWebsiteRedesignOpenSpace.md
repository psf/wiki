## Meeting minutes 

Written by Evelyn Mitchell and Kevin Altis

    Kevin Altis would like to see a 10x increase in the Python user-base in the
    next 2 years.

    Promoting Python
       leverage evangelism
          (what are the tenets of evangelism)
       website is very high visibility
          - don't have phone number or press contact

    I suggest that people interested in learning more about effective evangelism
    watch and read what Guy Kawasaki has to say on the subject. All of his books
    are quite readable, pretty short, and contain many amusing anecdotes. See
    the link below for more info; the signal to noise ratio is very good. [ka]

      http://pythonology.org/pipermail/marketing-python/2003-March/001124.html

    The main point about the website is that since we don't have traditional
    marketing and PR dollars, nor do we have normal phone and email contacts for
    people to get immediate answers about Python, the website needs to do that
    work for us. The site is the face of Python to the rest of the world. [ka]

    Who is the customer?
        people who don't use python today
        people who do use python today
            - information source
        lots of different types of customers
           identify use cases for groups of users

    We need to establish metrics
       track usage
       to ensure modifications that are improvements

    Adoption rate of python
       increase in traffic and new users of python

    By establishing some metrics in the web site stats such as total unique IP
    addresses, page views, and downloads per month, etc. we can see how our
    "popularity" is growing. Metrics should also tell us whether some of the
    "improvements" made to the site really did what we thought they would or
    ended up having a negative impact on usage. That way we aren't just guessing
    and modifying blindly. [ka]

    Not focused on technical solutions
       identify problems
       identify customers
       how are people using website
       what is missing
       what are websites we like
          (similar customer bases)

    At the Open Space, I didn't want to focus on the technical issues of
    implementing the site, but that conversation is okay to carry on in parallel
    here on the list. [ka]

    Kevin is comfortable with the site redesign process

    Product
       Mockups
       templates
          estimate work to estimate effort

    Before implementing any actual changes, we should make templates and mockups
    to get feedback before making the changes live. [ka]

    Current implementation problems
       No database backend
    I expect Aahz, Steve, Thomas, and other pydotorg maintainers to articulate
    the current problems they have maintaining the site, time sinks, and ideas
    for where we might make site maintenance easier and improve their lives. :)
    [ka]

    Make recommendations to current web maintainers and PSF members

    Process
       establish a working group empowered to make changes to the website
       the website is owned by PSF

    That's what this mailing list is about. [ka]

    Problems
       ownership of domain
       clarifying process to change website
          get authority delegated from PSF to implement changes

    Opportunities

    Recommendations
       5-6 people
       balanced between management and implementation

    Where is the effort to do the work going to come from

    Ongoing management is required to ensure that maintenance on an ongoing
    basis gets done

    Behind
       job postings that don't get uploaded
       50% of the mail to webmaster doesn't get answered
       webmaster workflow
          multiple responses

    Personnel
       Who is available to do work
       How much time do they have
       What are the skill sets

    Split off the PR effort from the language development effort

    Introducing Python Video
       done

    Appeal to the people who have the skills that are required
    Audience
       People who don't use python today
          recommendation from another source
          resource for further information
       Advanced developers
          defectors
       journalists who are trying to get more information
       Managers (tool selection)
       teachers
       python core team PythonLabs
       python contributors (community)
       newbies (programming newbies) non-programmers
       community of exiting python users
          job seekers
          event page
          books
          user group
          trainers

    What is python
    How do I start doing python

    Metrics
       identify customers
          python in business
          teaching/learning python
          then track traffic to the sub pages to discover customers

    wide diversity
       more general launching page
       home page is too complicated

    home page
       asking "what were you looking for. Did you find it"
       search - used to determine what they were looking form

    Analysis of search term metrics
       will be difficult because the access to the log is hard to get.

    We still have assets at CNRI
       seach.cnri

    Anyone interested in joining the python.org maintenance team
       Aahz says the team members are restricted to well known community
          members
       Give the appearance of needing help
       Give the appearance of being open to joining
       Look for volunteers

    Specific specialized areas of responsibility
       Python in education

    Kirby Urner for the edu-sig/Python in Education pages can be our test case
    of having page or section maintainers not directly involved in the
    maintenance of the rest of python.org. [ka]

    py.org experience

    Zope3
    ht to html still works well
    Wiki
       Needs a strong editor

    Which maintenances take the most time
       Where is the time going now?
          job listings
             add a form to allow for posting jobs
             add a secure form to allow for removing jobs
          event listings
             add a form to allow for posting events
          broken links
          webmaster mail
          help@python.org ->tutor
          reflector (a static page of suggestions)

    Jeff Eppler to work with Steve to do the PyCon website

    Credit card donations
       Paypal
       ShareIt
       donate.python.org

    python.org needs a certificate

    40% Documentation is the number one hit
    RDF file is also getting a lot of hits

    750000 hits
    unique IPs in march 180,000
       http://www.python.org/wwwstats


    Similar sites
       php.net
       mysql.com
       postgresql.org

    Web site computer resources are adequate for current needs
       10% load on the machine
       hot backup could be provided

    Continuing the discussion
      PSF board meetings
          forming a subcommittee or group of volunteers to carry on the work

    downloads of documentation
       faster to have unified download page
       too confusing

    "Get Python Now"
       Make the download of documentation very straightforward
       Matrix of choices

    python.org SIG design mailing list -> next action
       reimplementing SIGs

    pythonology.org
       a good new user site
       only if the support of the pages will come from the original author
