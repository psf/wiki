# Editing Guidelines 

- Be helpful: The ultimate test is to ask whether your wiki modifications provide real value to a reader. Examples of value are: give helpful resource, fix errors, make sentences shorter and more concise, make text readable, restructure.
- Be friendly: Make the wiki a friendly place that the community likes to revisit again and again.
- Be cautious: The wiki is visited by millions of Python coders. Respect the impact of each little entry - don\'t write half-baked content in the wiki.
