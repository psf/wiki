# Welcome to Pydotorg Central 

**Please note: This page explains the setup for legacy.python.org, not the new www.python.org site.**

This is your source of information for contributing to the python.org website.

To get started working on a local copy of the python.org website, you need to check it out from Subversion. To check it out for anonymous access (start here if you\'re new):

- `svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org`

To check it out with commit privileges:

- `svn co svn+ssh://pydotorg@svn.python.org/trunk/beta.python.org`

To build and run the site, see [build/README](https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org/build/README) in the checked-out beta.python.org tree.

You can monitor the build status on the [status page](http://www.python.org/status/).

For extra information, see [PythonWebsiteDetails](PythonWebsiteDetails)

## How Can I Help? 

To join the project, get started by getting a local copy of the site running. You can submit new tickets for bugs or improvements (see [PythonWebsiteCreatingNewTickets](PythonWebsiteCreatingNewTickets)) or work on content at wiki.python.org without having commit privileges.

If you want to become a committer, email pydotorg at python dot org for details. Please do this only after you\'re sure you will definitely be contributing changes.
