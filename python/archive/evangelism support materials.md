[PSF](http://www.python.org/psf) chairman [Stephan Deibel](StephanDeibel) aptly observed that these are \"needed:

- Slides / notes for presentation overviewing the PSF (I have some very simple slides I can provide as a start to whoever takes this on, and can help but can\'t lead this)

- Course materials for an \'evangelism training seminar\'

- Review of PSF web pages to make them more evangelist-friendly

- Possibly, printable handouts and other supplementary materials\". Some notes on this are on the [PsfMaterials](PsfMaterials) page.

This [Wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/) page is where we\'ll start to flesh out Stephan\'s outline. Note, for example, AMK\'s [slides for a talk on the Python development process](http://www.amk.ca/talks/python-dev/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the outline from my slides (the ones I attempted to show at [PyCon](PyCon) 2005 except my laptop didn\'t work w/ the projector). The slides are also available in [Powerpoint format](http://www.python.org/psf/psf-overview.ppt) and [OpenOffice format](http://www.python.org/psf/psf-overview.sxi):

AMK observes that, \"It might be worth creating a customized version of the S5 slide stylesheets so that PSF presentations can have a consistent look.\" (This work is now in progress.)

Also available, on request: both Stephan (through the [psf-volunteers](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-volunteers) list) and evangelism support materials czar [Cameron Laird](http://python.org/moin/CameronLaird) maintain a list of volunteers at least occasionally available to speak on Python, sorted by locale (DC, Seattle, Texas, Central America, and so on).
