I am a Python dabbler since early 2003. Most recently, I\'ve been supporting the pyparsing module, for creating recursive-descent parsers ([http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net](http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net)).

I live in Austin, Texas, with my wife and 2 kids, and work at a small consultancy doing software planning, development, and deployment projects for semiconductor manufacturing companies and their suppliers.
