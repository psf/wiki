# Vaults of Parnassus 

Quite a while ago the \"Vaults of Parnassus\" was a portal serving as a general storehouse of Python goodies. It was found here:

[http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/](http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/)

In 2008 people complained about missing updates to the site.

Unfortunately the page is inactive at the the time of this writing (Feb 25, 2012).
