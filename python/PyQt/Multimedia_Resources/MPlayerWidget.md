# MPlayerWidget {#MPlayerWidget}

MPlayerWidget is a widget wrapper around MPlayer. Unlike other solutions that use the XEmbed protocol to embed an MPlayer window in a user interface, this solution passes the X handle of an existing QLabel widget to MPlayer so that it can render its output directly onto it.

Henning Schröder posted a link to his PyQt (Qt 3) MPlayer wrapper widget in [a message](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2007-June/016277.html){.http} to [the mailing list](./PyQt(2f)TheMailingList.html). He has kindly donated the code to the community, and it can also be obtained from this page.
