# PyQt/pyqt4_and_twisted

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
This tutorial assumes that you have [twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com){.http} with [pyqt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php){.http} installed and working.

The first thing you will need is the [qt4reactor](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/1770/qt4reactor.py){.http}, which you can find on twisted\'s trac server.

\<notes: next step, do you need to install it before you can call it? How you do that, I\'m not sure.\>

\<note: [Ed Suominen](http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2006-September/014077.html){.http} has written a module that allows you to \"construct a non-blocking modal dialog, immediately obtaining a deferred to the user\'s eventual input\". I have absolutely no idea how to call this module.\>

\<note: This has no content! Here\'s some working code for integrating [PyQt4](PyQt4) with Twisted: [http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/05/26/code-sample-socket-client-based-on-twisted-with-pyqt/](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/05/26/code-sample-socket-client-based-on-twisted-with-pyqt/){.http}\>
