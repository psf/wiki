## The PyQt Mailing List {#The_PyQt_Mailing_List}

The [mailing list](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt){.http} provides support for sip, [PyQt](PyQt), PyKDE and eric. And sometimes, it\'s even funny to read.\
Archives are at [http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/){.http} or use [Google](http://www.google.com){.http} to search.

## People on the mailing list {#People_on_the_mailing_list}

Add your names here, along with shameless self-glorification Even better, create your own personal pages!

## Recent topics and digested threads {#Recent_topics_and_digested_threads}

- [Modular PyQt deployment with PyInstaller](./PyQt(2f)Modular_PyQt_deployment_with_PyInstaller.html)

- [CreatingMdiApplications](./PyQt(2f)CreatingMdiApplications.html){.nonexistent}

I think we should introduce a bounty for everybody who summarizes a thread here. Any ideas?

Some threads resulted in [SampleCode](./PyQt(2f)SampleCode.html) or [Overviews_and_Guides](./PyQt(2f)Overviews_and_Guides.html) being written.

## History {#History}
