# PythonWebsite/Learning

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).

At [PyCon](PyCon) 2009, Steve Holden suggested building a microsite for people who wish to learn Python.

We already have [BeginnersGuide](BeginnersGuide), but it\'s buried in the wiki and is pretty dense text. This microsite would have a cleaner design and fewer links.

## Possible names 

Vote here:

- Python 101 \[+1 sdeibel -1 mfoord\] (there is already a python101.com plus 101 means nothing to people outside the USA)
- Starting Python \[+1 mfoord +1 amk\]
- Python from zero \[\]
- Python from scratch \[\]
- Python for beginners \[\]

(Note: I ([MichaelFoord](MichaelFoord)) own the domain startingpython.org and would be happy to donate the domain to the PSF or administer it for this site.)

We should probably avoid \'Learning Python\', since that\'s an O\'Reilly book title. Likewise there is a book called \'Beginning Python\'.

## Content 

Notes on the current content are at [PythonWebsite/Learning/Top](./PythonWebsite(2f)Learning(2f)Top.html). The site primarily links to resources, so its page architecture is pretty shallow.

Should it target Python 2, 3 or both? Python 3 would be better, but would mean that initially it couldn\'t cover common third party libraries that haven\'t yet been ported to Python 3.

How about commissioning prominent authors to produce an article each on a range of subjects?

## Design 

To avoid spending volunteer time on yet another site design, we should just re-use the existing python.org page design (though not necessarily the same site-building script and infrastructure.)
