This page describes various things I want to try with a candidate tracker.

- Sign in as a developer and file a bug.

- File an anonymous bug, if possible. Assess how friendly this process is to a neophyte. Would the neophyte receive e-mail if further information is requested?

- Reclassify a bug as a feature request.

- Draw another person\'s attention to a bug.

- Attach a text file of output.

- Attach a screenshot.

- Attach a patch fixing a bug.

- Search for all curses bugs.

- Search for all bugs with attached patches.

- Close a bug as \"won\'t fix\".

- Close a bug as fixed.

- View a list of all 2.4 bugs.

- View a list of *my* bugs.

- Reassign a bug to the 2.5 category.

- Sort bugs by severity.

- Comment on a bug and receive an e-mail about the comment.

- Receive all new bugs per mail (and all updates)

- Add a comment to a bug/patch via email \-- [SkipMontanaro](SkipMontanaro)
