# Python Lore and Cultural Info {#Python_Lore_and_Cultural_Info}

This page is a collection point for various insider knowledge of the Python community, for compilation into a short, hopefully entertaining screencast for introducing people to the way things happen.

## Terminology {#Terminology}

Part of that is knowing the terms you often hear on the lists, both what it stands for *and* what it means. I\'ve heard these used as insider comments at past [PyCons](./PyCons.html){.nonexistent}, with newbies shaking their heads not understanding:

- [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It){.http} (you ain\'t gonna need it; yet another great new interface)

- DRY (don\'t repeat yourself)

- TSTTCPW (the simplest thing that could possibly work)

- (drat - at some previous [PyCon](PyCon) someone put up list of such

  - acronyms, and I can\'t remember them)

## Insider Jokes {#Insider_Jokes}

- Guido\'s time machine

- \"import this\"

- \"from [future]{.u} import braces\"
