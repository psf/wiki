I am interested in mentoring projects for development of mathematical libraries for (discrete) algebraic structures in Python, particularly those projects which relate to arithmetic of abelian groups, finite rings, and solution of algebraic equations over them, motivated by applications to cryptography. Of particular interest are applications which advance the development of SAGE [http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage](http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage){.http}.
