I made this wiki account to cleanup old and dead links to other pages. Since this task is repetitive i am thinking of building a bot.

## Wiki Pages I want to edit {#Wiki_Pages_I_want_to_edit}

[PythonXml](PythonXml): Does not mention xmlschema, has dead links

## Contact {#Contact}

Email: Rather not disclose. In the future, here will be an e-mail address you can spam-rape.

If you want to contact me, either edit this page in a gentle fashion or ask around on the mailing list for my e-mail address. If you do not know which mailing list - well, let\'s call it spam protection.
