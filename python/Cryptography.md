# Cryptography {#Cryptography-1}

Python includes several modules for [hashing](http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-hashlib.html){.http} and even basic [ssl support](http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-socket.html){.http} which is integrated into the socket module.

For more serious cryptography work, have a look at the following extension modules.

## Interfaces to OpenSSL {#Interfaces_to_OpenSSL}

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/){.http} is an open-source library that implements SSL and comes with a large number of very fast crypto and hash algorithm implementations.

- [M2Crypto](M2Crypto) - Python interface to OpenSSL

- [pyOpenSSL](http://pyopenssl.sf.net/){.http} - Python interface to OpenSSL, with focus on SSL networking

  - [eGenix pyOpenSSL Distribution](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/pyOpenSSL/){.http} - An easy-to-install distribution of pyOpenSSL

## Stand-alone Cryptographic Libraries {#Stand-alone_Cryptographic_Libraries}

- [Python Cryptography Toolkit](http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html){.http} - A collection of crypto-related algorithms and protocols implemented as Python extension

## Resources {#Resources}

- [python-crypto Mailing List](http://listserv.surfnet.nl/archives/python-crypto.html){.http} - A mailing list for discussing Python and cryptography
