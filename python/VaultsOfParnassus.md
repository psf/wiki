Quite a while ago the \"Vaults of Parnassus\" was a portal serving as a general storehouse of Python goodies. It was found here:

[http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/](http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/){.http}

In 2008 people complained about missing updates to the site.

Unfortunately the page is inactive at the the time of this writing (Feb 25, 2012).

If you were looking for a python package library you should go over here: [http://pypi.python.org/pypi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi){.http}
