I spend more time than I should but less time than I\'d like noodling around with Python. I\'m lucky though. I\'m retired now, but [TradeLink](https://tradelinkllc.com/){.https} and [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/){.https} used to pay me to program in Python. I also ride ([mostly](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmj3b97L){.https} [vintage](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmNGcmr9){.https}) bikes and even took a framebuilding class where I was able to [create my own frame](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjzHZes){.https}.
