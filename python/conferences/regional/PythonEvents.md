# Python Events around the World 

The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring around the world or online.

## Event Listings 

- For conference and user group events, please see the [PythonEventsCalendar](PythonEventsCalendar) page for details. The calendars are available on the python.org website as:

  - [Python Conferences Events Calendar](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/)

  - [Python User Group Events Calendar](https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/)

  or combined as:

  - [Python Events Calendar](https://www.python.org/events/)

  The calendars are maintained by a group of volunteers. If you want to submit conference and user group events, please see the [submission section](PythonEventsCalendar#Submitting_an_Event) of the project page. In recent years, the events calendars have grown to be a standard resource for people trying to find Python community related events, so we\'d like to encourage your submission to those calendars.

- If you are looking for training events in upcoming months, please see the [PythonTraining/Events](./PythonTraining(2f)Events.html) page.

- [TechVenue.com](http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=Python) has another calendar of Python events that includes regularly scheduled user-group meetings.

## Pointers 

### Python Conferences 

See the [Python Conferences](PythonConferences) page for a general overview of the different Python conferences.

If you want to organize a conference or event in your city or community, read [our guide to running a conference](./AdvocacyWritingTasks(2f)RunningAConference.html) for helpful advice.

Looking for speakers at various events? Check out the [list of Python speakers](PythonSpeakers)!

### Python Training

If you want to set up your own training event, refer to the [Python Training](PythonTraining) page on this site and add training dates to the [PythonTraining/Events](./PythonTraining(2f)Events.html) page. You can also add yourself to [Cameron Laird\'s](CameronLaird) page of [Python trainers](http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_training.html).

### Python User Groups 

Also see the [local user groups](LocalUserGroups) list for recurring local events.

## Calendar 

*This section is kept around for backwards compatibility*

Since the calendar on this page was only showing training events in recent months, we have moved those event listings to a new [PythonTraining/Events](./PythonTraining(2f)Events.html) page.

Please check the above list of calendars for conference and user group events.
