The [Columbus Public Library](http://www.columbuslibrary.org/) has been selected as the venue for [PyOhio](PyOhio) 2008.

Parking in the attached garage costs \$4 / day; consider carpooling or using public transportation, as well.

The following notes are being left here for future use (planning [PyOhio](PyOhio) 2009, for example.)

# Venue Considerations 

- Room for approximately 100-150 attendees.

- A single room or area big enough to hold everyone for a [plenary session](./PyOhio(2f)Schedule.html) or two.

  - (Is a plenary session mandatory? - [CatherineDevlin](CatherineDevlin))

- Space to break up into 2 concurrent talks of \~50 attendees each, plus 2 Open Space groups of \~ 20 each

- Wireless! Absolutely crucial if we have sprints, very desirable otherwise

# Possible Venues 

- Ohio Supercomputing Center
  - They did, after all, put this on: [http://www.osc.edu/press/releases/2007/python.shtml](http://www.osc.edu/press/releases/2007/python.shtml)

- Universities / colleges
  - \- OSU - Ohio University: Lancaster Campus (30 mi SE of Columbus) - Columbus State Community College - Franklin University - Otterbein - Ohio Dominican

- High schools

- Library
  - The Columbus Public Library has a very generous policy on letting groups meet: [http://evanced.columbuslibrary.org/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp](http://evanced.columbuslibrary.org/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp)

  - Auditorium fits \"200\" (I think that\'s optimistic, but the point is it should be enough for us, even for a plenary)

  - Auditorium has 22 power outlets; that should be fine, especially if we supplement with some power strips

  - Can serve food in auditorium

  - \"Board room\" seats 30

  - \"the Loft\", classroom with 20 computers already in place

  - 2 small conference rooms seating 15 and 10

  - Some of the rooms come with projectors

  - Lots of extra spaces could be used as overflow open space: glassed-in group study areas, etc.

  - They\'re OK with us reserving all the rooms

  - Rooms are pretty

  - Wireless

  - No charge

  - Well-known, central location

  - Accessible by bus

  - Parking in attached garage is not free (but it\'s \$4 / day, that\'s really not bad)

  - Rooms are not all contiguous (but I think it\'s OK for people to walk through the library a little bit)

- Private company
  - Anyplace with substantial Python-using population might be willing

- Training companies
  - The Cincinnati and Dayton branches of New Horizons have been friendly to user groups; is that true of Columbus?

- [OCLC](http://www.oclc.org/conferencecenter/default.htm)

  - It looks like a nice facility, and it\'s said they have some Python users. My only worry is that they\'ll want \$, but it can\'t hurt to ask.

- Art centers, community centers
  - I believe these would all require payment.
