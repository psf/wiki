# Internet access

OSU provides wireless internet access; however, university regulations require each user to get an account directly from a university employee. Last year, OSU provided an empowered employee to sit at registration on Saturday morning. Attendees filled out a short form and gave it to him to get wireless access. Once they had, internet access was fairly smooth.

However, that employee was only available Saturday morning. People arriving after he had left were out of luck; so were sprinters on Friday night.

I believe that the only way we can improve the situation is by bringing our own wireless structure with us.
