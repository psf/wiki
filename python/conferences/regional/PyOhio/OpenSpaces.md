# Open Spaces at PyOhio 

[Open Spaces](http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-Openspace.html) are set aside at [PyOhio](PyOhio) (and [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org), and many similar conferences) for attendees to create their own creative content on the fly. [PyOhio](PyOhio) will have 1-3 rooms available for Open Space use throughout the day; some of them will have overhead projectors.

## What can you do with Open Spaces? 

- Informal, unplanned discussion on a topic

- A cooperative workshop with multiple people contributing

- A [Teach Me Twisted](http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/2008/03/teach-me-twisted.html)-style learner-driven class (oh, please, let\'s do at least one of these!)

- A regular-style talk outside the regular talk schedule

- A follow-up discussion following a regular talk

- Something just for fun (board game, card game, sing-a-long\...)

- Anything else you can think of\...

## Who can schedule an Open Space event? 

You can! You don\'t need a detailed plan, and you don\'t need anybody\'s approval. All you need is a desire to see some people come together and learn from each other.

## How do I schedule an Open Space? 

There will be a large posterboard at [PyOhio](PyOhio) used for Open Space scheduling, with slots representing each available room for each time slot. Take an index card (they\'ll be provided), write down a topic and your name, and stick it to the board. Show up and see what happens!

Optionally, if you have a specific idea for an Open Space in mind ahead of time, you may propose it on this page (edit the page by clicking the word-balloon-shaped icon at the upper right of this page) by putting the topic name, your name, and any notes you want to add. That gives people a chance to work up some enthusiasm and ideas in advance. If you like, you show that enthusiasm by listing your own name here under the organizer\'s.

## Sounds crazy. Does that actually work? 

It does! People who\'ve tried it generally come quickly to love it. In any case, the [Law of Two Feet](http://www.openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm) means that you can try an Open Space event for \*precisely as long as you are benefiting from it\* - if you aren\'t, then you are obligated (not just allowed) to leave. There\'s no reason not to try it!
