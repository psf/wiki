# Columbus residents 

Can you help a friendly out-of-town Python user afford their stay in Columbus for [PyOhio](PyOhio)?

If you have space in your house / apartment / cardboard box, or if you\'re looking for someone who can loan space, please list your name and email address here (along with any other details that may be useful).

Thanks so much for helping make [PyOhio](PyOhio) a region-wide event!

# Non-Columbus residents 

If you plan to get a hotel room, and would like to share the room and cost with another [PyOhio](PyOhio) attendee, sign up here with your name, email address, and any other details that may be useful.

# Speaking of sharing 

Don\'t forget to check the [Carpool](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyOhio/Carpool) page.
