# Game Social 

I\'ll be bringing some board/card games. Perhaps on Saturday evening if folks are tired from sprinting, we might start up a fun game to socialize. This could be done either at the conference hall or the hotel. Details will likely emerge onsite and announced on here, on twitter and IRC.
