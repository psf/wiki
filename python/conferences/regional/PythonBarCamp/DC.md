# DC-Area Python BarCamp 

## Goals 

- 2-day event, held on a weekend in October or November 2008.

- Held in the DC or Baltimore area.

- Free admission, or admission \<\$10.

- Do we want to have swag, in the form of a T-shirt or tote bag?

- Will feature 1 track of self-scheduled talks on one day, and at least 3-4 sprints, up to as many as we have room for.

- \~40-50 attendees.
  - Broken down into 15-20 sprinters who mostly code all weekend (about 3 groups), and 20-30 people who come only on the Saturday for talks, and may ease into sprinting later in the day.
  - Sunday will therefore be smaller and quieter.

- If the venue doesn\'t have restaurants nearby, we\'ll need to provide food.

## Space requirements 

- At least two rooms on Saturday (talks in one room, sprints in the other).
- Tables that can seat at least 6 people (so, assuming 50-60 people, that\'s 8-10 tables)

We\'ll bring in easels w/ whiteboards or paper pads, or those static-clinging sheets for the wall.

## Talk ideas 

Talks on the first day should be a mix of offered and invited, going from more introductory talks early on to more advanced and specialized talks later. Possible ideas:

- A general Python intro (depends on the expected audience \-- newbie-heavy or not?)
- A Python-dev intro
- An OLPC talk
- Other ideas?

## Possible venues 

DC:

- [Josephine Butler Parks Center](http://www.washingtonparks.net/parkscenter.html), near U Street.

- U. of Maryland College Park

- GWU (CS dept, or Cafritz Center)

- Another DC-area university?

- Look for a hotel (downtown; near Courthouse or Ballston?)

- Strayer University

- Gallaudet

- Clark & Parsia\'s offices

Arlington:

- [Marymount](http://www.marymount.edu/academic/business/it/)

- [VA Tech](http://www.ncr.vt.edu/programs/CS.html) at West Falls Church

- Arlington schools (but the usual location is probably not good \-- too far from Metro)

Baltimore:

- JHU CS dept.

## Current tasks 

E-mail possible CS department contacts

- JHU: Michael Droettboom

- GWU: [Rahul Simha](http://seas.gwu.edu/~simha/) (supervised a project called \$ython).

- U. of MD: Bijan Parsia?

- Howard: [faculty listing](http://www.scs.howard.edu/faculty_staff.aspx)

- U. of DC: [faculty listing](http://www.udc.edu/academics/soe/faculty.htm)

Research hotel prices in the fall: Baltimore vs. DC; is one city much cheaper?

What to do about wireless, which is critical? Bring it in? Rely on the venue\'s wireless? What if it fails, which would cripple us?

## Budget notes 

Assuming 50 attendees, and assuming we get food (which is looking unlikely):

     1500? Venue
      500? Projector rental
     1500  Food for 50 attendees ($15 x 50 attendees x 2 days)
      250  Contingency 
      250  Equipment (power strips, etc.)
      250  Printing (signage, local map, etc.)
    ---------------------------
     4250  Total

Charging \$10 admission to 50 people only brings in \$500; we\'d need to charge at least \$80 to break even. Maybe we should just forget about charging admission and look for sponsorship instead.

*The Chicago BarCamp cut costs by borrowing projectors and other equipment from techies and businesses who wanted a mention; it cut out the food cost by borrowing microwaves and finding a venue near restaurants. Do it on the cheap!*
