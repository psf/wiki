## Accomodation 

Questions, hints and tips about where to stay, and requests for sharing.

**Question:** Is it possible to sleep at the university on air mattress and sleeping bag? This would be a nice and cheep alternative for poor students. Furthermore, this could provide a quite nice working atmosphere in the night. Is it possible to get a room for that purpose?

**Response:** No, it is strictly forbidden to stay overnight in any location within the university. There are nightguards ensuring that this policy is followed.
