**Soccer News**

- I will \"try\" to record it (from German 2nd channel (ZDF) and unattended, so I hope it\'ll be ok), burn it on a DVD and bring it to Benedikt who will be organising the showing (in Building 40, meet in the coffee area). As the copying/burning will take a while I guess we can start around 23:30 (for the main game, in case there is a extension, I\'ll bring this later). There is a (small I hope) chance that the recording will fail (Windows \...), but let\'s keep the fingers crossed.

Can we get some feedback how many people want to come? And we would need some volunteers to organize some beer and other drinks for the match.
