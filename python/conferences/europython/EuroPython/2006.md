[EuroPython]() 2006 was held at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch) near Geneva in Switzerland from Monday 3 July to Wednesday 5 July 2006. Sprints took place from 30 June to 2 July and 6 July to 9 July.

Since the conference is now over, this page serves as a record of the various information, plans and ideas that were put forward during the organising period, and this may be of interest to future organisers. If you merely attended the conference or are merely interested in attending future conferences, this might not be the right place for you \-- unless you want to become involved in helping out with the organisation of future conferences as well: something that is definitely encouraged!

The *centre of all things* of [EuroPython]() is the [mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython).

- [/IrcMeetings](2006/IrcMeetings) \-- a record of meetings on the #europython channel on freenode.

- [/People](2006/People) \-- people involved somewhat in organising the conference.

- [/TrackDescriptions](2006/TrackDescriptions) \-- a place for track chairs to put descriptions of their tracks.

- [/PublicRelations2006](2006/PublicRelations2006) \-- a place to discuss the marketing
