## Present 

Aiste, David, Paul

## Agenda/Minutes 

- Registration/Budget
  - *Laura* to indicate any change in the status of payment systems, WorldPay, and so on. *Laura couldn\'t make it to the last meeting, but based on previous reports, PayPal and \"pay later\" via bank transfer (and cash at the door) were assumed.* **Current indications suggest that PayPal and \"pay later\" will remain as the only options, with PayPal support being finalised.**

  - The PayPal details should be confirmed, as published here: [http://www.europython.org/community/Payment_Information](http://www.europython.org/community/Payment_Information)

  - Mentioning the recording policy ([http://www.europython.org/community/Audio_and_Video](http://www.europython.org/community/Audio_and_Video)) on the registration form. Should registrants have a box to tick? **Correspondence with John suggested that it might be too confusing to do this, although issues with lightning talk recordings would arguably be reduced by such a measure.**

  - T-shirts - any proposals or plans? See [this page](http://www.europython.org/community/T_Shirts)! **Still waiting for ideas!**
- Keynotes
  - We have preliminary acceptance by one keynoter. What now to make it official? **Laura is apparently waiting for confirmation.**

  - Any progress on the consensus around streaming and dedicated lines?

  - *Aiste, Marius, Laura:* Update on the videoconferencing arrangements. **Google has apparently taken control of this process.**
- Sponsorship
  - Further discussion of the [SponsorOffers](SponsorOffers) document.

  - Brief discussion of existing offers from sponsors.

  - Further discussion of the sponsorship of attendees (plus any information that should be published).
- Feedback/Surveys
  - Progress on the processing of last year\'s surveys
