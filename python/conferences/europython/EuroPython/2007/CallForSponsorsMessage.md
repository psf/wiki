# EuroPython 2007: Call for Sponsors 

This year, [EuroPython](EuroPython) will take place from Monday 9th July to Wednesday 11th July in Vilnius, Lithuania. As the premier pan-European Python event, this is a great opportunity to reach dedicated users of Python in business and academia, as well as influential members of the Python community. Last year\'s conference was a great success, and we would like to offer you the chance to participate in this year\'s event as a sponsor or an exhibitor. With your support, your organisation can share in the success of [EuroPython](EuroPython) 2007: the sixth annual conference in the well established and highly regarded conference series for the European Python and Zope communities.
