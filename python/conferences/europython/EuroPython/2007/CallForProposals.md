# EuroPython 2007: Call for Proposals 

Book Monday 9th July to Wednesday 11th July 2007 in your calendar! [EuroPython](EuroPython) 2007, the European Python and Zope Conference, will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania. Last year\'s conference was a great success, featuring a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and inspiring keynotes. With your participation, we want to make [EuroPython](EuroPython) 2007, the sixth [EuroPython](EuroPython), even more successful than the previous five.

## Talks, Papers and Themes 

This year we have decided to borrow a few good ideas from [PyCon](PyCon), one of which is to move away from the \'track\' structure. Instead, speakers are invited to submit presentations about anything they have done that they think would be of interest to the Python community. We will then arrange them into related groups and schedule them in the space available. In the past, [EuroPython](EuroPython) participants have found the following themes to be of interest:

- Science
- Python Language and Libraries
- Web Related Technologies
- Education
- Games
- Agile Methodologies and Testing
- Social Skills

In addition to talks, we will also accept full paper submissions about any of the above themes. The Call for Refereed Papers will be posted shortly.

**The deadline for talk proposals is Friday 18th May at midnight (24:00 CEST, Central European Summer Time, UTC+2).**

## Other ways to participate 

Apart from giving talks, there are plenty of other ways to participate in the conference. Just attending and talking to people you find here can be satisfying enough, but there are three other kinds of activity you may wish to plan for: Lightning Talks, Open Space and Sprints. Lightning Talks are very short talks that give you just enough time to introduce a topic or project, Open Space is an area reserved for informal discussions, and Sprints are focused gatherings for developers interested in particular projects. For more information please see the following pages:
