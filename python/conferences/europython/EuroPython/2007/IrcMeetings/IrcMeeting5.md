# IRC Meeting #5 

## Minutes 

(From an incomplete IRC log - thanks a lot, X-Chat!)

- Promotion:
  - python.org now has an announcement for the Call For Proposals.

  - The [EuroPython](EuroPython) site now has a more visible \"submit a talk\" link.

  - Benedikt has spread the word at CERN.

  - The CFP should be sent to europython-announce.

  - Armin and the [PyPy](PyPy) people could mention [EuroPython](EuroPython) at [RuPy](./RuPy.html).

  - Bea suggested contacting ZEA in order to get the word around in the Zope community.

  - David suggested contacting Ron Stephens for the Python411 podcast.

  - Paul reminded everyone about [EuroPython2007/ArticleForPythonPapers](./EuroPython2007(2f)ArticleForPythonPapers.html) (and will edit it some more).

  - Aiste will translate the CFP into Russian and try and promote it in the Russian speaking world.

  - Other \"channels\" have been informed - see [EuroPython/2007/PublicRelations](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)PublicRelations.html) for a table and feel free to update it!
- Opening times: Aiste will inform the mailing list about facilities and their opening times/availability.
- Sponsorship:
  - Contact points:
    - The europython-sponsorship mailing list is still active.
    - Michael suggested a sponsorship at europython.org address.
  - Benedikt or Michael will look into Google participation.
  - Commercial concerns:
    - Paul noted that [PyCon](PyCon) feedback had been somewhat negative about sponsored talks.

    - Michael said that sponsor lightning talks had been \"mildly ridiculed\" by some people.

    - Laura noted that some people regard [PyCon](PyCon) as being \"too commercial\" and warned about having too many \"talks about what people are doing at work\" rather than cool stuff.

    - David mentioned that \"more employers are sympathetic to community events\", referring to employers\' expectations of what their employees are going to be doing at the conference.
  - Packages:
    - Harald mentioned that sponsors are comfortable with \"gold/silver/titan\" sponsorship levels and it can be a basis for negotiation.
    - It was agreed that by having preset levels (or suggestions), it makes the conference look more marketable.
    - Paul argued that being prepared was critical so that potential sponsors could be handled, but that being flexible (listening to what sponsors are used to) is important.
    - Bea wondered about budget and venue issues.
    - Aiste noted that four booths could be accommodated.
    - Aiste will check with the hotel about sponsor streamers at the entrance (mentioned in the previous packages).
    - The sponsor information template was located in CPS.
  - It was decided that a better idea of budget coverage and facilities was needed for the next meeting, along with more ideas about what sponsors might want.
- A time limit of one hour was suggested for subsequent meetings.
- Next meeting was suggested for Monday 16th April.

## Time/Location 

The meeting will take place on Monday 2nd of April (2007-04-02) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.*

## Agenda 

No agenda yet. Suggestions:

- Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: \"education\" and \"social skills\" are missing; \"agile\" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.

- Promotion: we\'re on python.org now, but what other channels should be involved? See [EuroPython/2007/PublicRelations](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)PublicRelations.html) for interesting avenues, along with some materials used by the [PyCon](PyCon) organisers.

- Sponsorship. Any motion here?
  - [EuroPython](EuroPython) sponsorship has become fairly unobtrusive: Web site banners, some promotional activity at the conference.

  - In contrast, [PyCon](PyCon) has maintained the previous \"sophisticated\" sponsorship plans: [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HowToSponsor](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HowToSponsor)

  - Some resistance to promotional keynotes and lightning talks is detectable in the [PyCon](PyCon) feedback: [PyCon2007/Feedback/Comments](./PyCon2007(2f)Feedback(2f)Comments.html)

  - Perhaps a dialogue with potential sponsors is better than the usual bronze/silver/gold categories.
