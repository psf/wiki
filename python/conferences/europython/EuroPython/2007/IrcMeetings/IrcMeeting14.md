# IRC Meeting #14 

## Time/Location 

The meeting will take place on Monday 11th June (2007-06-11) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.* The suggested duration of the meeting is at most *one hour*.

## Minutes 

- Laura reported that the PSF can support students with travel expenses, and that the travel expenses is on top of the sponsorship amount they provided.

- The schedule needs to be put into Indico - this has since been done.

## Agenda 

- Bea and David will report about any progress made with getting invited speakers to the conference.
- Laura will clarify the funding situation with regard to travel expenses and the PSF.
- Paul, Bea, Harald(?), Laura and Michael will report on the current sponsorship status.
- Aiste will report on the status of printing facilities.
- David is continuing to follow up on Simon.
- David Axmark\'s bio details need to be finalized.
- Announcements - which ones need to be done this week?
- Schedule - this needs to be finalised and added to Indico (or an alternative solution proposed).

## Notes 

See [the calendar](http://www.europython.org/sections/calendar) to get an idea of where we should be at this point in time.

Paul added the \"alternative solution\" part for the schedule - CERN\'s Indico instance may not be usable enough.
