## Notes 

See [the calendar](http://www.europython.org/sections/calendar) to get an idea of where we should be at this point in time.

Paul mastered Indico timetabling after finding the \"Other room\" option. This will eventually become the master timetable (and is already linked to from [http://www.europython.org/timetable](http://www.europython.org/timetable)).
