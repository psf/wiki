# IRC Meeting #6 

## Time/Location 

The meeting will take place on Monday 16th of April (2007-04-16) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.* The suggested duration of the meeting is at most *one hour*.

## Minutes 

- Aiste will upload a hotel registration form for attendees into CPS.
- People will collaborate on the mailing list or via program at europython.org on the missing theme descriptions.
- Promotion:
  - europython-announce now carries the Call For Proposals.
  - Nicolas will take up contact with ZEA in order to promote the conference in the Zope community; Python411 has been notified; David will get a template from The Python Papers and attempt to submit the article for the next edition; Aiste has issued the announcement to at least some Russian language communities.
- Sponsorship:
  - Google have been contacted, but may be contacted again by Michael.

  - No additional ideas were provided for sponsorship packages, although it was suggested that the [existing text](http://www.europython.org/workspaces/ep-2007/sponsorship) could be revised to emphasise Web banner sponsorship, with programme sponsorship not mentioned but possibly replaced with other \"attendee bag\" advertising.

  - Nicolas was going to look at the financial plan to get ideas of sponsorship rates. A general idea of budgetary constraints is needed: attendee rates should be decided, too.

  - Attendee materials/packages/bags could be produced, according to Aiste, but this is dependent on sponsorship demand and organiser interest: quotes for printing can only be sought if we know what we want to produce. Nicolas thought that some kind of programme might be useful.

## Agenda 

Suggestions:

- Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: \"education\" and \"social skills\" are missing; \"agile\" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.

- Promotion:
  - Status of europython-announce.
  - Status of contacts: ZEA (Bea), Python411 (David), Python Papers article, Russian translation (Aiste).

- Sponsorship:
  - Contact points: revitalising the europython-sponsorship mailing list and providing a sponsorship at europython.org address.

  - Web banners!

  - Participation of Google, other previous sponsors (Benedikt or Michael).

  - Ideas about sponsorship packages/levels, rates, facilities: see [Aiste\'s message](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-April/006307.html) for details.

- Opening times: see [Aiste\'s message](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-April/006307.html) for details.

- What materials will be given to attendees? At CERN, it was vital to give people maps and site information (as well as badges). See [this message about The Python Papers](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-February/006226.html) on the topic of \"bag inserts\".
