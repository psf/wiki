# IRC Meeting #4 

## Time/Location 

The meeting will *probably* take place on Wednesday 28th of March (2007-03-21) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.*

## Agenda 

No agenda yet. Suggestions:

- Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: \"education\" and \"social skills\" are missing; \"agile\" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.

- Promotion: python.org needs to pick up the CFP announcement and other channels should be involved. See [PyCon2007/Feedback](./PyCon2007(2f)Feedback.html) for interesting avenues, notably mailing lists for other Python-related and Free Software projects.
