# IRC Meeting #10 

## Time/Location 

The meeting will take place on Monday 14th May (2007-05-14) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.* The suggested duration of the meeting is at most *one hour*.

## Minutes 

- Registration
  - It was decided that registration would open as soon as the infrastructure is ready, hopefully Tuesday 15th May, after final testing of the process.

  - Changes to the student rates were agreed. (See [EuroPython/2007/FeeStructureAttendees](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)FeeStructureAttendees.html).)

  - Registration details will be published along with special accommodation details once registration is enabled.

  - An announcement of registration will be prepared with information about keynote speakers, a reminder about paper submissions. Information for potential sponsors may be made available in full as a separate announcement.
- Keynote speaker #3 is still uncertain, or at least no news from Steve is forthcoming.
- Sponsorship
  - Aiste will pursue other avenues within Google.

  - Michael had nothing to report.

  - The [EuroPython/2007/CallForSponsors](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)CallForSponsors.html) was finalised with deadline details.
- Related to sponsor deadlines, the issue of programmes was discussed with various points of view expressed:
  - Some people prefer paper programmes, others would find PDF versions acceptable.
  - \"On demand\" programmes might be nicer to the environment, but previous experiences with self-service arrangements (eg. in 2005) apparently led to disappointment.
  - Some kind of paper version, albeit not a \"posh\" one, seemed to appeal to the meeting participants.
- Visa issues were discussed, with the group agreeing\...
  - That registrants requiring visas have to sort the bureaucracy out themselves. In other words, contact the appropriate entity, be familiar with the procedures, and so on.
  - And that such registrants requiring visas would most probably need to provide the \"reason for participation\" which already appears in the registration form.
  - That the letter of invitation is as involved as the organisers are prepared to be on this matter. This is consistent with other conferences - GUADEC being just one example.
- The questionnaire results from last year\'s conference will be made available by Aiste.

## Agenda 

- Registration
  - Special accommodation details and forms have been made available, but now need to be published.

  - The registration form (and Indico \"workflow\") should be approved and published. Benedikt was to complete the e-payment section, but anyone with knowledge in this area might like to assist.

  - Any last minute negotiations about student rates should occur at the meeting so we can make the announcements and forms available. (See [EuroPython/2007/FeeStructureAttendees](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)FeeStructureAttendees.html).)
- Keynotes
  - Steve needs to confirm what\'s happening with keynoter #3.
- Sponsorship
  - Aiste will report about the current status of Google.
  - Michael will report about any progress with his contacts.
- Announcements
  - We should agree to make announcements about the above points this week.

  - The text and timing of the keynote announcement, [EuroPython/2007/CallForSponsors](./EuroPython(2f)2007(2f)CallForSponsors.html) and registration announcement will be finalised.
