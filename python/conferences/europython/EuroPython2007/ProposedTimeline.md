## Previous Observations and Speculation 

*What follows is just some notes about previous/other conferences and timelines.*

From the [conference Web site](http://www.europython.org/) for 2006 (before it gets overwritten), plus observed administrative milestones:

::: {}
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  17th March           *[Web site goes live](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-March/005652.html)* [(first sign of interest for registering/booking)](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-March/005673.html)
  3rd April            [Call for proposals (talks)](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-April/005715.html)
  27th April           [Keynote speakers announced](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-April/005755.html)
  15th May             Paper acceptance notifications
  17th May             Registration opens
  26th May             Early bird registration closes
  31st May             Deadline for talk summaries (proposals)
  4th June             Talk schedule announced
  11th June            Normal bird registration closes
  24th June            Paper submission deadline
  26th June            Online registration closes
  30th June-2nd July   Pre-conference sprints
  3rd July-5th July    [EuroPython](EuroPython) conference
  4th July             Conference dinner
  6th July             CERN visit
  6th July-9th July    Post-conference sprints
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

This is a big contrast to the original [IRC meeting](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-January/005555.html)-agreed timeline which was optimistically decided upon well in advance of the 2006 conference:

::: {}
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  15th February       Call for Proposals
  March               Opening online Registration (Payment issue pending!)
  31st March          Deadline for proposal submissions
  30th April          Prelininary Program with accepted talks
  19th May            Closing Early Bird registration
  3rd July-5th July   [EuroPython](EuroPython) conference
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
:::

Given the [panic](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-May/005764.html) in May 2006 about the conference status, it might be best to not let the timeline slip much later than that of 2006.

## Comparisons 

It\'s always fun to compare things! Comparing the above with [PyCon 2007](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EventCalendar):
