Bazaar (formerly known as Bazaar-NG) is a distributed version control system that aids open source development and reduces barriers to participation. We\'re currently on a performance drive, a lot of the preparation work has been done at the last sprint in London, [http://bazaar-vcs.org/SprintLondonMay07](http://bazaar-vcs.org/SprintLondonMay07) You don\'t have to already be familiar with the code to help make a difference.
