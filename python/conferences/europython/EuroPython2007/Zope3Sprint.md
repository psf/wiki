Zope 3 Sprint

- Where: Vilnius, Lithuania

- When: after [EuroPython](EuroPython), 12-14 July

- Organizer: Marius Gedminas \<[marius@pov.lt](mailto:marius@pov.lt)\>

I have long planned to add coloured output to the Zope 3 test runner. (The old [SchoolTool](SchoolTool) test runner had it, and I can attest that it helps greatly to identify the key parts of test failures in the long test output). If there\'s time left, I might look at some other small tasks to make the Zope 3 developer\'s life more pleasant. (The Zope 3 developer in question is, of course, Yours Truly ;-).

If you intend to participate, please put your name here:
