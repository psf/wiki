The [PyPy](PyPy) project will hold an open sprint at CERN after Europython. While you should have good proficiency in programming Python, no experience with the [PyPy](PyPy) source tree is necessary. There are plenty of tasks which involve porting library module to Python and making sure that various tests pass. However, if you want to participate in the more advanced aspects of [PyPy](PyPy), you should spend some time on downloading and understanding the documentation and source code.

Is there a separate list for the sprint elsewhere or am I the first who wants to participate ? [PieterZieschang](./PieterZieschang.html), 29.05.06

- The sprint planning has not taken place publicly yet, of course there will be many other people joining the sprint. Have a look at [the pypy-sprint mailing list](http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-sprint/). \-- [AlexanderSchremmer](./AlexanderSchremmer.html) 2006-05-29 14:05:13
