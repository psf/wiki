# Python packaging sprint at EuroPython 2020 

We welcome package maintainers, backend and frontend web developers, infrastructure administrators, technical writers, and testers to join us at sprints to help us make the new PyPI, and [the entire packaging/distribution toolchain](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pypa-projects), as usable and robust as possible.

We\'re working on Warehouse, pip, bandersnatch, wheel, and more. We\'re using Pyramid, Pylons, StimulusJS, CSS, static typechecking with mypy, ElasticSearch, Sphinx, and regular Python, and we also need help with Travis CI and continuous integration, and Anaconda and Windows support.

Or, if you just want to learn to **use** the tools to package your scripts up and distribute them on PyPI, we\'ll help you with that, too.

Newcomers are welcome \-- we\'ll help you learn and contribute!
