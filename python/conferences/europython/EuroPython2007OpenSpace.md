# EuroPython 2007 Open Space 

Although Open Space is a dynamic element of the conference, proposed and scheduled as things happen at the venue, it\'s still likely that participants have a few topics to suggest even before the conference begins. This page will collect suggestions before and during the conference; precise scheduling and more topic gathering will be done at the venue during the conference. Look out for the Open Space scheduling boards!

## Suggested Topics 

- Python 3000 - migration, porting, 2.x and 3.x co-existence, etc.

- The future of [EuroPython](EuroPython) (plus other conference activities) - oiling the wheels of the machine!

## Planned Sessions 

These are sessions which attendees are planning on doing.

- **Interest in a purely business oriented Python, Zope and Plone conference ?**

  [eGenix](http://www.egenix.com/) is looking into organizing a special one day conference specifically for companies doing business with Python, Zope and Plone. The conference would likely be held in or near Düsseldorf, Germany. The session is meant to test interest in such an event and whether the focus we have in mind fits the potential attendees interests.

- **eGenix Partner Network**

  [eGenix](http://www.egenix.com/) is currently under way to setup a [partner network](http://www.egenix.com/company/partners/). This session is intended to initiate discussions with interested companies in the Python community and may well also be of interest to other companies wanting to set up a partner network.

- **MoinMoin Wiki Users/Developers Meeting**

  [MoinMoin Wiki](http://moinmo.in/) users / developers could meet to talk about misc. topics: core and plugin development, tuning, current and future versions, news from Summer of Code 2007. \-- [ThomasWaldmann](ThomasWaldmann)
