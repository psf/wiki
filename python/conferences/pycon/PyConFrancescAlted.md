# Processing And Analyzing Extremely Large Amounts Of Data In Python 

## Presentation Notes 

My talk will describe [PyTables](http://pytables.sf.net), a Python package that enables the end user to manipulate easily scientific data tables and [Numeric and numarray](http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy) Python objects in a persistent, hierarchical structure. The foundation of the underlying hierarchical data in permament storage is the excellent [HDF5](http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5) library.

I will be walking through the basic features of the [PyTables](PyTables), and demonstrating the use of the package in real-life scenarios. In addition, I will present some benchmark where [PyTables](PyTables) will show to be competitive when compared with other persistent databases in Python.

This presentation is currently [scheduled](http://www.python.org/pycon/pycon-schedule.html) for 10am on friday March 28th.

I would like to target my presentation as best I can to those people attending.

So please add questions/suggestions below; for example:

- I would attend if \...

- Will [PyTables](PyTables) run on \...

- etc.
