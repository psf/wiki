# Introduction 

This page concerns the talk on \"Unit Testing in Python\" that I gave on March 26 at the [PyCon](PyCon) 2003. If you missed the talk, you can view the [slides on my Starship Python page](http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/UnitTestTalk/). You may also download the slides from [my Starship ftp directory](ftp://starship.python.net/pub/crew/tbryan/). The slides and code are both available as .tgz and .zip files.

I\'d appreciate any feedback on the slides or the talk itself. Feel free to hit the Edit Text link and add your comments or questions to the section at the end. For more about me, see my Python wiki page [TomBryan](TomBryan).

This paper was prepared with the ability to support two talks. While all of the content is available in the conference proceedings, I only presented part of the content during my scheduled time slot.

# Unit Testing in Python 

This talk is based on one I gave for the the [Triangle Python/Zope User Group](http://dev.zope.org/Members/tbryan/TriZPUG/FrontPage) in November 2002. I extended the content for the [PyCon](PyCon). The original talk covered the following topics:

- Definition of unit testing
- Why should you unit test?
- What does Python provide for unit testing?
- Simple example of using doctest
- unittest terminology and history
- Simple example with unittest
- Test-driven development with unittest
- Overview of more advanced unit testing issues
- What to expect when you start unit testing

I cleaned up the existing content and added more. I covered some of the more advanced topics, such as

- Refactoring test fixtures beyond the setUp and tearDown methods
- Writing testable code
- Using mock objects
- How to organize and run your tests
- More advanced options in unittest

# Feedback from visitors to this page 

Feel free to add feedback on the talk (how to improve the slides, other resources, etc.) to this section. \--Tom
