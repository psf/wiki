:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

This page is to keep track of how the various social networking sites are hosting [PyCon](PyCon) content by users.

## PyCon Web Site 

Use [the PyCon schedule application](http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/) to plan your schedule. You can click on events and talks you\'d like to attend, and then export your selected events in iCal format or print a customized schedule. Your choices are saved on the [PyCon](PyCon) server, letting the organizers compare the popularity of various talks and letting them change room assignments to meet unexpected demand.

Each event has a perma-link and is now integrated with [Add This!](http://www.addthis.com/) So it is easier to use the other social network options on this page directly from the schedule.

## Linked In 

We have created a [PyCon](PyCon) 2008 group on [LinkedIn](./LinkedIn.html). If you are registered for [PyCon](PyCon), your registration e-mail is already pre-approved for joining the group.

Join the [PyCon 2008 Linked-In Conference Group](http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/64606/475053320818).

## Internet Relay Chat 

During the conference, many attendees will chat using IRC on the #pycon channel on irc.freenode.net.

## Talk Slides/File Publishing 

The [PyCon](PyCon) [Schedule](http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/) supports the upload/download of slides, documents, images, etc.

To upload files for your talk, just go to the [schedule](http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/), bring up the tooltip for your talk, click on \'upload\' under \'Files:\' and fill in the form.

## SlideShare 

Presentations in PowerPoint/OpenOffice/PDF format can be posted to [the PyCon 2008 event](http://www.slideshare.net/event/pycon-2008).

Presenters, please be sure to also upload your talk slides and documents to the [PyCon](PyCon) website\'s [schedule application](http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/).

## Flickr 

Tag any photographs you take at [PyCon](PyCon) with [\"pycon2008\"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/pycon2008/).

## Twitter 

Anyone can post to the [PyCon twitter](http://twitter.com/pycon) channel.

During the conference, the organizers will post tasks and volunteering opportunities to the [pyconvolunteers](http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers/) channel.

## Jaiku 

[Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com) is a micro-blogging site like Twitter, but with some extra features. Unfortunately, as of this writing (2008-02-23) they are not open to accepting new accounts while they deal with their acquisition by Google. Pre-existing members, though, do have a limited number of invitations they can give out.

On Jaiku there is a [#PyCon](http://jaiku.com/channel/PyCon) channel as well as a general [#python](http://jaiku.com/channel/python) channel.

## Pownce 

From the site: \"[Pownce](http://www.pownce.com) is a way to send stuff to your friends. What kind of stuff? You can send just about anything: music, photos, messages, links, events, and more.\" It\'s written in Python using Django and offers functionality similar to Twitter/Jaiku.

## CrowdVine 

There is now [a CrowdVine community for PyCon 2008](http://pycon2008.crowdvine.com/). Once you sign up for the community, you can send comments to other members and write weblog posts that everyone can see.
