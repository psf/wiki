### Comments, Suggestions?

- I am not sure I can make it, but I will bring my board games \-- Sheila
- I would like to see [Robo rally](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18). \-- ? Looks like we\'ll need a few experience players. - Dean; I\'ve only played it once I don\'t mind if the experienced players beat up on me. Wow! It\'s been reprinted. I just ordered it. \-- Sheila :) \-- I\'ll bring my copy \-- Jono.
- I would like to play on Thursday after evening volunteer activities are completed. \-- ? Sounds fun, but we may want to choose something light if we\'re tired from Tutorials and bag stuffing. \-- Dean; That\'s what Apples To Apples is for \-- Sheila; Excellent! Carcassonne, Munchkin, and Chinese Checkers may also fit this bill. -Dean \-- What time would this be? \--Larry
- I\'ve got Empire Builder, Russian Rails and Lunar Rails. Need external interest of I\'m going to haul them, I enjoy these but am still learning. Longer play time. \-- Dean
- I\'ll bring the games I\'ve mentioned above if there\'s solid interest; I might have to drive (vs. taking the El) if I\'m bringing more than one, though. --- Tom; I\'m interested in Ticket to Ride, Fluxx and curious about Arkham. - Dean
- I have Kill Dr. Lucky if I can find it \-- Sheila
- Any folks interested in Power Grid? - Dean
- I was curious what board game is most like Galcon, or if there\'s a particular game that would be themed for a Galcon varient? [Galcon Event](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4529). [Hellas](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4529)?
- I wanna try Alien City\--it\'s one of the Piecepack games. [http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/AlienCity](http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/AlienCity) \--Larry
