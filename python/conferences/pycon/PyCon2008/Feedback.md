    They all were wanting for greater quality of content

    - web2py open space talk w/ Massimo Di Pierro

    Lightning talk format is great.

    Lightning talks

    Plenary: OLPC Update

    honestly, most i saw were junk. too short, so by the time the
    presenter motivated the talk, time was up. and 40m/talk? that made
    it impossible to make sure you were at the next one at a normal
    time. how about starting talks on the hour. simple.

    The Twisted SFC membership announcement. I'm feeling The Love!

    Ivan Kristov - OLPC Keynote

    honestly, almost none of the talks i heard are worth mentioning -
    they were all too short (every presenter was rushed), the timing
    was hard to gauge (since everything started on odd times, 40m past
    some hours, 10 after other, etc), and quite frankly not that many
    presenters were well prepared.

    Twisted Announcement/Keynote

    Richard Jones' Pyglet talk (why not listed?)

    Lightning talks on PVote, NoonHat, and SaturdayHouse

    No.106, towards interactive, distributed and rapid testing

    some of the openspace meetings + lightning talks where really useful

    had scheduled those online and were a bit more organized with them.

    repoze - chris mcdonough

    I really enjoyed the tutorial on TurboGears and Pylons. Good teachers
    and very informative.

    The Twisted BoF at 8-10 on Saturday; most keynotes v. good as well.

    Hallway track

    I am self employed and the company paid registration and I used
    airline miles and hotel points

    I decide how much to submit

    I originally wasn't sure if Python would be usable in my work, but
    I'm picking it up to do web projects personally - I think I will
    put in for some reimbursement though as I got a lot of great ideas
    that I can use even if I'm not successful in bringing python to our
    systems.

    I paid for my food, and for lodging during sprints; registration,
    travel, and hotel during conference covered by school/employer

    I paid for the conference days, my employer paid for me to attend
    the Sprint.

    I received Python Software Foundation financial aid this year. woot.

    I traveled/roomed with a friend, and PSF paid my registration fees.
    THANKS!

    I used some of my grant money.

    My company paid for my registration
