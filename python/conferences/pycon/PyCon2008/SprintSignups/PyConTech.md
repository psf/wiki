**Project Info**

PyCon-Tech is a conference management framework based on Django framework. While PyCon-Tech is intended for the various Python Conferences, anyone can use the framework or Apps therein which are released under the Python License. The page you are reading right now is being served up by the PyCon-Tech Wiki. PyCon-Tech has grown into a website building framework with pluggable applications for building wiki\'s, web site generation, feed replication, navigation bar, surveys, cache management, times tables generation, and that is before we get to anything conference related. PyCon-Tech it\'s no longer just for building conference sites.
