### Project Info

Grok brings automatic, Rails-like auto-configuration functionality to the Zope component framework and Zope web application server. But this functionality is currently bound up inside of a single \"grok\" module; you can\'t use, say, Grok\'s ability to auto-configure Zope adapters without importing the whole dratted web framework with it.
