# PyCon DC 2005 For Cheap 

See also [PyConDC2005/Accommodation](./PyConDC2005(2f)Accommodation.html).

### Register Early 

Registration prices are \$50 cheaper in advance than at the door.

### Save On Meals 

The conference serves a continental breakfast from 8-9 every morning, and a lunch. There are a number of restaurant choices near by; consult [PyConDC2005/NearbyRestaurants](./PyConDC2005(2f)NearbyRestaurants.html)\] for a list.

### Hotels 

If you\'re looking to keep hotel prices low, you can stay at a hotel out in the burbs and take advantage of the [metro system](http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/default.cfm).

One of the best bets appears to be [Best Western Key Bridge](http://www.bestwestern.com/prop_47096) in Arlington VA; it is half a block from the Rosslyn metro station, one stop away from GWU. *I\'ve stayed there for cheap at past conferences, but rooms are running \$119 this year - Jeff Kunce*

Anyone find anything else? Don\'t be shy!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I won\'t be shy. This is Pat O\'Brien. I\'ll be giving a presentation on [Schevo](http://schevo.org/). I just got a room at the [State Plaza](http://www.stateplaza.com/) on Priceline for \$50/night (plus tax). It\'s only three blocks away from the conference. Not too shabby, huh?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got Marriott Washington Westend at \$63 plus tax from Priceline (Foggy bottom 3\*). Seems to be within walking distance to the conference. Wai Yip Tung.

Check out this Google Maps search for [motels, arlington va](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=motels%2C%20arlington%20va). I found one that was \$89/night.

### Hostels 

(For the budget-conscious, who know they aren\'t going to be spending much time in their hotel anyway.)

Beds at the [Washington International Student Center](http://www.washingtondchostel.com/) go for \$22/night, and there\'s at least one private room for \$55/night. Breakfast & kitchen facilities included. It\'s located in the Adams-Morgan area (\"on the hippest street in town\"), near the Dupont Circle metro station, about 3 km (2 miles) from [PyCon](PyCon) (GWU). Open to anyone, not just for students.

### Flights 

[National Airport (DCA)](http://www.mwaa.com/national/index.htm) is on the metro system but is usually the most expensive.

[Dulles Airport (IAD)](http://www.metwashairports.com/Dulles/) may be cheaper but requires a shuttle to the West Falls Church metro station that costs about \$7. Bay Area residents may want to fly [JetBlue](http://www.jetblue.com/) from Oakland (OAK) into Dulles.

[BWI](http://www.bwiairport.com/) also serves the DC Metro area and has transportation to the metro system. It is the farthest away but usually the cheapest. [Southwest](http://www.southwest.com/) flies out of BWI a lot, be sure to check their web site for fares.

Getting to the DC Metro System from BWI: You can take the Marc train[http://www.bwiairport.com/4grndtrn/in_mrct.shtml](http://www.bwiairport.com/4grndtrn/in_mrct.shtml) from BWI to Union Station to catch the metro or you can take the Metro Express Bus [http://www.bwiairport.com/4grndtrn/in_mb.shtml](http://www.bwiairport.com/4grndtrn/in_mb.shtml) which will take you to the Greenbelt metro station.

### Other Transportation 

The conference is close to Metro (subway). If you\'re taking the train, [Union Station](http://www.unionstationdc.com/) is on the metro system. Amtrak stops there. Union Station is a quick train ride from the conference site, much easier than the airports. Amtrak is often similar price to flying, but depending on the length of the trip, can be much easier and more pleasant.

Consider 1-day or 7-day [Metrorail Passes](http://www.wmata.com/riding/passes.cfm) if you\'re staying on the metro line out on an edge stop where the fares will be higher, especially if you\'ll be travelling during peak hours (05:30 - 09:30 15:00 - 19:00 weekdays) (which you will if you want to see the keynotes :-)).

Visit the [Metrorail Stations](http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/stations.cfm) page and click on your starting station (e.g., Vienna / GMU) to calculate fares and determine whether or not a pass is worthwhile.

### Parking 

See [http://cafritz.gwu.edu/cafritz.php?id=1929&site=cafritz](http://cafritz.gwu.edu/cafritz.php?id=1929&site=cafritz) - a full day of parking is \$13. This is downtown DC, you won\'t easily find a better deal. Street parking is all metered with a 2 hour limit. When the garage is full, there\'s another one one block to the west with similar rates.

Don\'t park illegally - DC police \*will\* ticket or tow you. The no-parking signs are very confusing but worth careful reading. Also avoid the faculty parking lots.
