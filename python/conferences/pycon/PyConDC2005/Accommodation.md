## Accommodation near PyCon DC 2005 

A hotel in Arlington located near a metro station would be a good choice, because Foggy Bottom station is a brief (15-minute) ride away. Somewhere to the west would work best. The orange line of the Metro system runs from Vienna, VA through Falls Church and Arlington to the GWU stop. Anywhere else will involve a transfer and extra travel time.

See [the Arlington Hotel Guide](http://www.arlingtonlodging.net/) for a list. For example, the Quality Inn at Court House is about two blocks from the metro.
