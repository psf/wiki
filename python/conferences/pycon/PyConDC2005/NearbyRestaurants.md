This page will list restaurants near the [PyCon](PyCon) conference site. If you have a particularly good or bad experience with a particular restaurant, or discover a good one that isn\'t listed, please add your account to this page.

Georgetown, an upscale neighbourhood to the west of the Foggy Bottom area, has many fine restaurants as long as you\'re willing to walk there; parking is scarce and buses aren\'t particularly frequent. If you\'re willing to walk somewhere for dinner, though, you could consider Georgetown.

Several Metro stops are connected to huge food courts. Union Station is probably the largest. Washington\'s small Chinatown district surrounds the Gallery Place/Chinatown Metro stop.

The Metro station closest to [PyCon](PyCon) is Foggy Bottom; walk up to Eye Street and turn left, walking a few blocks west.

If you\'re trying to use a store locator, the Cafritz Center\'s Zip code is 20052.
