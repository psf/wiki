PyConSteveHolden is the name of the [PyCon](PyCon) page for [SteveHolden](SteveHolden). Not very clever, really, but useful enough to devote Wiki space to. Who reads these things, anyway, right?

## Network Infrastructure 

Here\'s how I described [PyCon](PyCon) to the Cafritz Center contact Meghan Steed:

- I don\'t imagine we\'re a rabidly unusual audience for a venue like yours, though perhaps tending a bit towards geek. ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)") Most networking would be internal, I imagine, and apart from email most would only want sporadic web access. While I could have volunteers donate or loan 100 MHz Ethernet infrastructure, I wondered whether to ask Aron to negotiate terms for a few nice \"Network Infrastructure \...\" pieces of signage in for the week in return for a few well-placed 16- or 24-port switches or hubs. I believe we still have gaps in our marketing program.

If this is drastically below what you \[*yes, this means you, hello?\...*\] **personally** require, please feel free to share any additional infrastructure you may have available. Or at least let me know.

I plan to entitle my Introductory remarks *Because It Works*.
