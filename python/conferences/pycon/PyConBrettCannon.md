This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

I plan on making sure that enough detail is covered so that anyone attending the tutorial will be able to read the [python-dev Summaries](http://www.python.org/dev/summary/) with no problems in regards to the [reST](http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html) syntax.

The slides (in some form or another) can be found at [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/\~bac/rest_tutorial.html](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bac/rest_tutorial.html)
