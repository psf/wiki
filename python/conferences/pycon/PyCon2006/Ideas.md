- We need a new location.

- Have a dedicated tutorial track on at least one day. (Perhaps paralleling the open space?)

- Have a newcomer\'s track on the first day: intro to Python, [PyCon](PyCon), open space.

- One person suggested a track at reduced cost aimed at teenagers: [PyCon2006/TeenagerTrack](./PyCon2006(2f)TeenagerTrack.html). That\'s an interesting idea; we could have it on the Friday when attendance is at its lowest, and rustle up speakers on game programming, tutorial topics, and other stuff.

- Make organization of Open Space more apparent.

- Make [SubEthaEdit](./SubEthaEdit.html) notes an officially supported thing, and part of the proceedings

- We should post a list of talks + abstracts outside each room so people know what\'s going on.

- Keynote speakers should be relevant to Python.

- From [EuroPython](EuroPython): Have multiple tracks, and track chairs responsible for each one.

- Pay airfare and/or hotel for some invited speakers

- Sponsorship: mention that amounts are suggested minimums, not requirements

- Social events: a game night; a jam session (Barry thinks he can get most of the required equipment, or rent it).

- Get session chairs to estimate attendance in their sessions (half full, full, near-empty); this will let us calibrate our understanding of what topics people are interested in.

- Cut down food quantities a bit on the last day

- Have coffee at lunchtime

- Advertise conference more to local university students

- Get projector and run slide show at registration (announcements, lost/found items, open space, etc.)

- Make lightning talks a plenary session

- Encourage formal speakers to also do a lightning talk based on their presentation

- Give sessions titles (e.g. \"Web Development\", \"Networking\", \"Grab Bag\")
