# Internet Programming with Python 

### Audience/Who Should Attend 

Developers familiar with Python who are interested in exploring client-server socket programming, Internet client development, and CGI programming.

### Description 

Python is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which is Internet programming. This tutorial introduces current Python programmers to three distinct areas of Internet programming, each in self-contained one-hour lectures:

- Network Programming using Sockets \-- underneath all of today\'s network protocols, i.e., web/HTTP, FTP, database connections, IM conversations, online gaming, e-mail exchange, etc., lies the root communication mechanism, sockets. Here, we introduce client-server architecture and how to program sockets using Python.

- Internet Client Programming \-- one level higher than sockets are well-known Internet protocols such as FTP, NNTP, and POP3. In this hour, we learn how to use Python\'s standard library to create clients of those and other Internet protocols.

- CGI Programming \-- yes, pure CGI is \"sooo yesterday,\" but before you jump on all the web framework bandwagons, it\'s a good idea to learn basics and the **basis** of how all web servers deliver dynamic content back to the client browser so that you can appreciate all the work that is done on your behalf by a more full-featured framework.

This tutorial gives a concise and comprehensive introduction to each of these topics so attendees can \"start coding back in their hotel room\". A demonstration of code follows each lecture topic. We have had great success and feedback giving this tutorial in the past, such as at the [O\'Reilly Open Source Convention](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2993).
