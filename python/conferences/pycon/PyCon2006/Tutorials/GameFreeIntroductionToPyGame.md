If you want to do graphics, sound, and non-stdio user interaction in Python, [PyGame](PyGame) offers you a nicely-wrapped interface to SDL \-- and to some handy SDL libraries for drawing, fonts, image formats, and transformation, plus efficient interaction with Numeric/numpy arrays.

This tutorial will take you through the basics of the [PyGame](PyGame) library by way of a few simple sample applications. It will not focus on games: topics of general interest will be covered, as opposed to game-specific topics such as plot, pacing, and frame rate.

The tutorial will include some hands-on experience changing sample [PyGame](PyGame)-based python programs, but will be mostly lecture (with the opportunity to ask questions). We will not be covering sound, fonts, sprites, or Numeric/numpy interaction.

Intended Audience: Intermediate Python programmers

(experienced SDL programmers are unlikely to learn anything)
