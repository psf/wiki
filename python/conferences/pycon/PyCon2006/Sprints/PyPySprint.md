------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few [PyPy](PyPy) developers will be present at [PyCon2006](PyCon2006). At that point in time we expect the Just-In-Time compiler to be under heavy development, but we don\'t have to work on it, depending on the interest of the people present. The goals of the sprint are not specified in advance: we can do work in any area of [PyPy](PyPy) that interests you.

You can mention your participation and talk about your interests in the pypy-dev mailing list ([http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev](http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev)).
