## TurboGears Sprint at PyCon 

We\'re going to be building up new features and squashing stubborn bugs at the [TurboGears](TurboGears) Sprint at [PyCon](PyCon). This sprint will come after the first [TurboGears](TurboGears) 0.9 release happens and will be a good chance to fix things up for 1.0 and start on features that will land post-1.0.

Experienced Python (and/or [JavaScript](./JavaScript.html)!) programmers are welcome. Even without prior experience with [TurboGears](TurboGears), there will be plenty you can contribute.

Discussion about this sprint will take place on the [turbogears-sprint@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears-sprint) mailing list.
