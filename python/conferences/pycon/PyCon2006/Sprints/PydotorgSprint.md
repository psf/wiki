Chat/help on IRC at #pydotorg on freenode.net

To join the project, ask on IRC to be added to the Trac notification list and the pydotorg mailing list.

To get set up with a copy of the site you need first to install Pyramid as described at [http://pyramid.pollenation.net](http://pyramid.pollenation.net)

Then check out [https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org](https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org) and see build/README to build and run the site on your machine

Also needed for conversion will be the old python.org content which can be checked out of [https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/pydotorg](https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/pydotorg)
