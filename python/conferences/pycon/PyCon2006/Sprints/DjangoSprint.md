We\'ll have an introductory session Sunday (2/26) afternoon (around 3:30) to get to know each other and plan out the goals, followed by four days (2/27-3/2) of sprinting. Exactly what we\'ll work on will be determined at the planning meeting. Below are the ideas we\'ll discuss at the planning meeting:

- Wrap up magic-removal (and merge to trunk if we get that far).

- Bug fixes - we should come out of the sprint with no serious (i.e. crash-level) bugs.

- Review and apply outstanding patches.

- Work on Oracle/MSSQL/ODBC/??? database backends.

- Documentation improvements - leave no stone undocumented.

- Work on a Django application repository (\"Django standard library\").

- Schema evolution.

- Transactions

- Multiple authorization backends (LDAP, OpenID, \...?)

- Proving our mousey worth.

- Shooting each other in the face.

- [other easy stuff.](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/LittleEasyImprovements)
