We\'ll be working on a Django-based application to be used for [PyCon](PyCon) 2007.

## Goals 

- A first-draft system, and plans for its future development

## Requirements 

This section lists features that the final system should support. We\'ll prioritize which ones to work on at the sprint.

- Paper submission, processing, and acceptance
- Assembling the schedule
- Registration
- Attendee feedback, during and after the conference
- Admin interfaces for changing registrations
- Sending e-mails to various subsets of users (e.g. all attendees, all committee members, all accepted authors)
- Most properties should be configurable (e.g. conference name, critical dates, prices), though maybe not through the web.

Some ideas for the paper-submission portion are at \<[http://www.amk.ca/w/ConferenceSWIdeas\>](http://www.amk.ca/w/ConferenceSWIdeas%3E).

## Participants 

Please list your name here if you think you\'ll make it.

Stephan Deibel \-- If there is a pydotorg sprint, which is still not certain, I may have to do that instead or in addition.

- Martin Thomas - though trying to decide how to split self between this and Django
