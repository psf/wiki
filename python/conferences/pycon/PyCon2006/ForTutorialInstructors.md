# Tutorial Instructors 

This is a place for tutorial instructors to pool their resources, make AV equipment inquiries, discuss materials, and ask questions. Specifically, I\'d like to talk about:

- Material duplication:
  - [Link to PrintShops nearby](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PrintShopsNearby2006)

  - Duplicating at home and bringing them to Dallas?

  - Doing them in Dallas near the venue and arringing delivery or pickup? (if so, who?)

  - OR not going to provide materials at all?

  - For those who are, what is your timetable? Pick provider yet?
- Anyone using more than a projector and microphone?
- How would people feel about contributing their notes to a compendium and having the organizers sell it as a volume to all attendees?
  - This is meant for those who either could not attend a tutorial that they wanted to because they\'re going to one that\'s more important to them, i.e., time conflict

  - Or it could be for those who could not attend tutorials at all but want the material

  - Would you expect remuneration? If so, how much?

  - Remaining funds could be used to help offset conference costs or saved for the next [PyCon](PyCon)

*I\'m interested in what everyone has to say\... pls feel free to edit this page. I may arrange to arrive earlier Wednesday afternoon, so I could help out with materials if need be. -Wesley (wescpy at gmail.com) 12/31/05*

Another thought related to audio recordings is that they can be given away for \"free\", we could charge a small fee for the slide presentations, and have a larger fee for the combination of the audio clips and the notes. The fees could be used to help offset duplicating the materials, the conference, and/or the instructors. Thoughts? -Wesley, 07 Jan 2006

I\'m going to be doing the printing / collating and binding here - and shipping it to Dallas. That way I can verify that everything\'s done right at least a week before the conference. Then, I\'ll ship it all directly to the hotel - hopefully soon enough that \_just in case\_ something goes wrong I can get it reprinted & bound in time to bring it with me. (I consider these expenses to all be part of my overhead - I don\'t expect additional renumeration for doing this.)

I\'m not going to need a mike - trust me. I hope to have two laptops and a kvm. (I might consider requesting / renting a second projector - it\'s not necessary, but if the price isn\'t too outrageous, I\'d be worth it.)

To be honest, I\'ve never thought about \'redistribution rights\'. I\'ve never done anything before that someone thought worth re-distributing.

[FedEx](./FedEx.html) Kinko\'s willl, I hope, be handling my logistics. I just hope they cost less than the fees ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)")

I plan to publish the course slides, with a few accompanying notes, as PDF under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license. I\'d like the PSF (and any local groups and schools promoting Python) to be able to benefit by this, so the license does permit commercial use.

I\'m used to driving a two-screen presentation system, but can manage with one when I\'m slumming it ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":)") I will only have my laptop to generate images anyway, so two screens would likely be showing the same thing.

Having a lavalier mic or similar is invaluable if someone loses their voice (it **can** happen) but like Ken I normally handle up to 30 students without a P.A.

andrew has given me the OK to coordinate putting together a tutorial presentation compendium for sale at [PyCon](PyCon) for attendees who could not attend some or any of the tutorials but would like to purchase all the notes:

this is similar to what they do at OSCON only you buy them separately there \-- we can flirt with this option as well. it\'s not a \"conference proceedings\" but i think it has some value. also, others have independently given me their opinion that they would be interested in purchasing such a tome.

the point of sales is to attempt to cover as much of your duplication expenses as possible for the tutorials you\'re giving as well as the duplication expenses for the compendium.

hopefully, we can cover \*all\* of everyone\'s expenses and still have some leftover for [PyCon](PyCon) 2007 or to give to the PSF. comments?

##### Wesley Chun :: 2006 Feb 21 

DEADLINES \-- i must have your tutorial PDF(s) in my inbox by:

1.  tutorial notes only: Wed, Feb 22, 4pm
2.  compendium: Thu, Feb 23, 5pm
