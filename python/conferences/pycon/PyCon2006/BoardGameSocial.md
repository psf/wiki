At [PyCon](PyCon), AMK is planning to have a session on Thursday evening to play board games. It will be at 7PM, in the Bent Tree II room.

It\'ll probably work like this: I\'ll set up the games beforehand, and as people show up, they get grouped together in sets of four or six and choose a game, or are assigned one. I explain the rules and get the group started.

I\'ll box up a bunch of my games and Fedex them to myself at the hotel. However, there are probably local attendees who can also bring games. If you\'re coming to [PyCon](PyCon) and can bring something, please add your name to this page and say what you can bring.

- What games would you like to see?
- What games can you bring?

# Games 

- Carcassonne, of course! (+ River, Inns&Cathedrals expansion for up to 6 players)

- Through the Desert (not going to arrive in time)

- La Strada (not going to arrive in time)

- Travel Blokus (not going to arrive in time)

- I\'ll probably throw in Fluxx and Set, too, because they\'re in small packages. (not going to arrive in time)

- Go (Igo/Weichi/Baduk)

- [IceHouse](http://wunderland.com/icehouse/Default.html)

- Nomic

- Richochet Robots

- Metro

- Backgammon

- Blokus

- Labyrinth

- Nexus

- The Settlers of Catan (I don\'t own a copy but enjoy playing it. \--Jeff Rush)

- Set (A pattern recognition card game\...very easy to learn)

The emphasis is on multiplayer games that can handle four or six people. I don\'t think two-player games are very practical for me to bring, because I\'d have to bring so many of them; hopefully local attendees can bring chess, go, checkers, etc.

# Comments 

*Damn, and here I was leaning towards going to [EuroPython](EuroPython) next year, and you go and introduce board games into the mix \-- [RichardJones](RichardJones)*

*As a \_long\_ time gamer, I\'m \_definitely\_ interested in this. I can bring two or three different games if desired. \-- Ken Whitesell*

*This sounds like a great idea. I can bring my extended [munchkin](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/) collection to the table (super-star-fu-bites-munchkin-blender anyone?) \-- [MichaelTwomey](MichaelTwomey)*

- I am sooo there, will bring some packs as well. \--DougN

*[Go (aka Igo/Weichi/Baduk)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)) anyone?*

- I\'m a Go player; I\'d love to have a game or three. Who\'s asking? \-- [DavidGoodger](DavidGoodger)

- I added GO above as I will bring my board. I will also bring some 13x13 and 9x9 boards on cardstock so more than two people can play fast games at once. \--DougN

*I\'ll concentrate on bringing some modern German-style board games that are fairly easy to learn, so that new arrivals can play something entertaining. \--amk*

*Backgammon, anyone? I will bring a board or two. And of course, certainly there won\'t be any gambling ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)") \-- [JonRosen](JonRosen)*

*I\'ll bring some extra packs of Fluxx as well. Ever had a game of Fluxx with 25 people and a 15 second time limit per turn? its a blast!*

I\'ve never had a chance to play [Nomic](http://www.nomic.net/), but I\'d like to \-- this seems like a group that might enjoy such a game (like Fluxx without the structure). I\'ll print up the materials to bring along. \-- [IanBicking](IanBicking)

While i will be unable to attend, i\'d suggest [Ticket to Ride Europe](http://boardgamegeek.com/game/14996). Great 3 - 5 person game, each turn is super fast, easy to learn. Has been a big hit with friends and family. \-- [JosYule](./JosYule.html)

*I\'ve played Ticket To Ride, on the original American board, and agree that it\'s a fun game. Unfortunately I don\'t own a copy, but maybe someone else does. \--amk*

*I can bring the following games if anyone else is interested: the Dune boardgame (the Avalon Hill out-of-print classic), Cosmic Encounter, and Puerto Rico. All these are great multiplayer strategy boardgames. \--Brad Allen*

- RE: Cosmic Encounter, are we talking about the Mayfair version? I would really look forwards to joining in a CE game. \--Kerry Lazarus

*Is this only going to be Thursday, or might there be a Friday evening party as well? (I\'m driving up Thursday evening from Austin\...) I\'ll bring along my copy of Carcassonne, as well. \--Peter Wang*

*Peter: if people want to meet on Friday (perhaps around 6 or 7PM, after the mod_python BoF, that\'s perfectly OK. Feel free to add it to the [PyCon2006/FinalSchedule](./PyCon2006(2f)FinalSchedule.html) page. \--amk*

The largest Dallas-area game store, The Game Chest, is only about 2 miles away. Anyone want to go on a group shopping trip on Sunday evening or Monday? \--amk

I think I\'ll pass on the Game Chest trip, unless they have a used copy of AH\'s Civilization in stock. ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":)")

I\'ve gone ahead and put us down for another session at 6:30 Friday in Bent Tree (after the BOF). \--Peter

I\'m packing Slapshot, Democrazy, Trans America and Acquire. A second evening of gaming always sounds good to me. Definitely interested in any trip to a game store as well. (5 months until the WBC!) \--Ken
