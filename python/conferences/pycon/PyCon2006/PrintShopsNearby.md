- This is not an exhaustive list. If these shops don\'t suit you, post a note on the [PyCon](PyCon) mailing list and I will get others added. I looked for 5 Print Shops that were close to the Marriot Quorum, where [PyCon](PyCon) 2006 is being held.

# Overall notes 

- All the printers can create collated sets of handouts on normal american sized papers. That means 8.5 x 11, 8.5 x 14 and 11 x 17. I\'ll comment about other sizes available. All printers listed can take paper copies to be duplicated, but I expect people will want to submit electronic copies to be duplicated. Every printer expresses a strong preference for PDF files as the format to receive. I\'ll comment about other formats that are accepted.
- I asked them all about delivery times for what I thought was a normal job. The normal job is a printout to be used for tutorials and would be 50 copies of 40 to 100 pages each. Bigger jobs may take longer, so ask if time is important.
- I think any of these shops should be fine, but I do have editorial comments on a couple. They are listed in the order I visited them, so don\'t read anything into the ordering.

- This would be my first choice of these shops. I would expect a decent, but not the best price. They seemed very professional and I looked at a few works in progress that looked first class.

- I have used them for printing, so don\'t take this too harshly, but they are less professional than any other print shop in the list. The people there just basically run copy machines and I would not go to them with anything tricky. They do stand behind their work and my copies were fine, but I would put this shop a step behind the others in the list.

And here is another list from someone else, from Google maps and run it through an XSL transform.
