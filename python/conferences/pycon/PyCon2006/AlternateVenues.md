  - 3 Floors of meeting rooms ranging in sizes from small to large.
  - Available March 21 - 25, with sprints and/or open space rooms available 2 days before and/or after.
  - Cost is \$85 per person per day, which includes rooms, beverages (coffee and soda), AV, lunch, service charges, and parking.
  - Rooms available for reservation.
  - Wireless complimentary in public areas (hallways), and to get a line into each meeting room we\'d need \$175 per line per day. We can install our own switch and/or 802.11 access point.
- Stamp Student Union (University of Maryland College Park)
  - Contact Paul Prescott (301-314-7881) or Stamp Student Union (ask for reservations: 301-314-3375)
  - Grand ballroom supports 800 people, auditorium style
  - Hoff theatre supports 500 people
  - Food is catered (same as UMUC above)
  - The food outlets in basement are closed during spring break
  - There are rooms that hold 100 - 250 people, including the colony ballroom
  - Recommended talking to UMUC, as it is more self contained and perhaps more appropriate. Am waiting on a callback from Stamp Union.
