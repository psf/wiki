## Jython track at PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! 

Hm\...judging by the [PyConSchedule](./PyConSchedule.html), there won\'t be much Jython discussion in the official talks. Perhaps we can organize some [BoFs](./BoFs.html) or [OpenSpace](OpenSpace) discussions at the conference.

Add your own ideas.

- Intro to Jython (I have an outline for this topic. -TAB)
- Introducing Jython to a Java development team.
- Differences between Jython and Python
- Embedding Jython in a Java application. (submitted -aeden)
- Using Jython in J2EE development.
- Jython development tools: editing, debugging, etc.
- Scripting Java with Jython

## Jython BOF 

We did end up having a Jython BOF on Friday, March 28, at 9 a.m. It was attended by about a dozen people (add your name if you feel like it). Since the theme of the conference was \"Popularizing Python,\" much of the discussion centered around how Jython is used and how that could help popularize Python. We have started a [CategoryJython](CategoryJython) page on this wiki to help track issues related to Jython.

I was at the Jython BOF:
