# PyCon India 2010 -- Call for Proposals 

[PyCon](PyCon) India is the only conference of its kind organized in India for Python programming language enthusiasts from all over the country. [PyCon](PyCon) India is being held in Bangalore, India for the second time from Sep 25 to Sep 26 \'2010 at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.

The organizers of Pycon India 2010 are looking for talk proposals to fill the formal presentation tracks. We accept proposals on a very broad range of topics related to Python programming.

You might be a software developer who has written or worked in an interesting Python project, a young programmer just out of college learning Python, an academic who has solved problems using Python in a research project or a hobbyist exploring different Python packaging options -- in short anyone who is passionate about Python and has spent some time on it. As long as the proposal is interesting and has something potentially useful for the Python community, we will consider it for inclusion in the conference.

Please follow the instructions below carefully before preparing a proposal and submitting it.

You can also opt for a talk which is 30 minutes long. Such talks should typically discuss how to do a certain thing related to Python in a concise way.

The talk length includes the time for audience interaction implicitly. You should prepare your talks so as to leave at least 5 mins room at the end for taking audience questions.
