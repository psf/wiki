63 Talks 3 Favorite Talks

Please list your 3 favorite talks.

Disclaimer: these are not scientific counts.

- - People are often vague (does \"OO talk\" mean Alex Martelli or Bruce Eckel?)
- - Some people wrote down more than three talks (e.g. \"Roundup and Traits\", \"Alex\'s talks\" \-- both votes were counted in this case).
- - Some votes were ignored because I couldn\'t figure out what talk they referred to.
- - All votes for a lightning talk were counted as a vote for \'Lightning talks\'.
- - All votes for something in open space were counted as votes for \'open space\'.
- - Keynotes have an unfair advantage because so many people see them.
