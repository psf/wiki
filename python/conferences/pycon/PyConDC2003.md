## Topics for PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! 

[PyCon DC 2003](http://www.python.org/pycon/) is not going to be an elitist conference. It needs your help to ensure that there is something for everybody! Matt Croydon\'s notes in [/ForCheap](./PyConDC2003(2f)ForCheap.html) might help.

What can you do? Well, firstly you can ***contribute your ideas on this page***. It\'s easy to edit Wiki content, so get to it - just click on **Edit Text** below! The more contributors we have, the more relevant and interesting [PyCon](PyCon) DC 2003 will be. A few topics are listed below to get you started, but you should feel free to add others if you believe the [PythonCommunities](PythonCommunities) will benefit from having them covered at this, and future, conferences. You can show your support at [PyConRandomExclamationsOfSupport](PyConRandomExclamationsOfSupport).

***IMPORTANT***: When making a change, consider whether you should sign it. E.g., proposals for sprints are best accompanied by a name or email address so that we can contact you regarding further details, etc. Remember that \"I\" doesn\'t really refer to anyone in a Wiki.

There is a PyConIRCChannel: #pycon on irc.freenode.net.

### Registration Fees 

The correct price schedule is, to quote GvR:

***- Early bird (through Feb 1) \$175***

\- Normal reg (until March 17) \$250 \<\-- correction!

\- Walk-ins \$300 \<\-- correction!

You can now register at

- pycon.org

See you there!

(earlier this said \$150 \$200 \$250 \... Registration will open soon, with the help of YAPC.)

### What Can I Do for PyCon? 

See the [PyConHelpers](PyConHelpers) page for areas where volunteers are currently needed, and please feel free to sign up there. Also to add other areas where you think you\'d like help \-- *SH*

### Birds of a Feather Sessions 

In many conferences the [/BoFs](./PyConDC2003(2f)BoFs.html) are where much of the real communication takes place. If your particular area of interest doesn\'t manage to generate its own track then at least register your interest on the [/BoFs](./PyConDC2003(2f)BoFs.html) page so people can sign up for it.

### Sprints 

The sprints are intended to benefit the Python core, as well as encouraging more developers to take part in Python\'s development. They will also be a good place to see [ExtremeProgramming](ExtremeProgramming) or other [AgileMethods](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileMethods "Wiki") in action. What would you like to see done, or at least attempted?

There is a separate [/SprintPlan](./PyConDC2003(2f)SprintPlan.html) page with more details. *Please use it to flesh out the sprint plans.*

### LightningTalks 

At IPC 10 the Developer Day had many short talks on diverse topics. If you can\'t produce a full-blown paper, offer your own talk (as short as five minutes is acceptable) to distill a part of your hard-won experience and save others the learning time you put in. Or just say what you\'d like someone else to give a lightning talk on.

- *Probably \"lightning\" is 15 minutes max \-- however, [PyCon](PyCon) [OpenSpace](OpenSpace) means that we don\'t distinguish that much between \"lightning\" and \"what people want to hear and can persuade someone to do\".* \-- SH

The idea of lightning talks has also been extended to the possibility of lightning tutorials where the audience brings their laptops and a tutorial of around 15 to 30 minutes is held. Think of them as lightning talks with heavy audience participation. \-- brett

I\'m thinking about giving one or more talks on how to be a python developer. Topics could include: submitting patches, helping with bug reports, updating documentation, adding/updating tests, etc. I\'d be interested in what people believe is important. \-- neal

How about a lighting tutorial on Python in 3D? In fact I\'ll volunteer to do a 30 minute workshop on VPython. \-- Justin Shaw

- *A 30-minute tutorial would only be acceptable if there weren\'t a long install required.*

I am very interested in this \-- [jim.vickroy@noaa.gov](mailto:jim.vickroy@noaa.gov)

See the [PyCon2004LightningTalks](./PyCon2004LightningTalks.html) page for notes, presentations. \-- [fawcett@uwindsor.ca](mailto:fawcett@uwindsor.ca)

Feel free to sign up to give a talk that somebody else has suggested.

- *Practical ssh* \-- to explain in simple terms that we can all understand how ssh works and how you can set it up for secure remote access to as many systems as you need. \-- *I\'ll do this SH*

- *Cygwin benefits* \-- how to be a good open source community member even though you run the Evil Empire\'s operating system on your laptop.

- *CVS: Don\'t Leave Home Without It* \-- A quick tutorial on how to set up CVS, particularly with respect to using it remotely via SSH (though local machine use will be covered as well). \"CVS is to programming as saving is to games.\" Do it in case you make a mistake or your machine freaks out\... (jafo)

- *Modules* \-- Pick a module (standard or third party) and talk it up. Go through some basic usage and perhaps some advanced tricks. This could be lots of fun and extremely informative.

  - *[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html)* \-- Lightning tutorial on the markup and basic usage of the tools included with [Docutils](http://docutils.sf.net/) for generating HTML pages from reST files. \-- brett

  - Distutils. This is a module that causes a lot of confusion and isn\'t used widely enough yet. Techniques emerging in distutils 1.0.3 (such as \--install-script on win32) should be covered.

  - rfc822 \-- It\'s not just for breakfast any more. rfc822 makes parsing e-mail headers and e-mail addresses extremely easy. But it can be useful for parsing a whole slew of information. For example, I use it to parse requests to an e-mail-based calendaring and reminder system. (jafo)

  - pyPgSQL \-- Samples of the use of pyPgSQL to communicate with a Postgres database. Covered will be DBAPI compliance and extra functionality that makes life really nice. (jafo)

### Volunteers 

The absence of professional organizers is the main way to keep the cost of [PyCon](PyCon) down, but this means we\'re relying on YOU to help. Volunteer efforts don\'t need to be all-embracing \-- if we can share the load then no one individual needs to suffer a heart attack to make things happen. This section will detail areas where help is needed, and you are encouraged to put your name down to offer assistance. Make it *your* conference. Make it *our* conference. This is a community effort, and it needs people to ***get involved***.

- [PyConGopherCentral](./PyConGopherCentral.html) - we\'ll post updates for gophers here

- [PyConToDo](./PyConToDo.html) - we\'re keeping track of what\'s left to do here

### Work Opportunities 

Should there be a mechanism for disseminating info to people interested in python jobs or people with python jobs available? It would be nice for these folks to identify each other.

### Progress Reports 

There are many areas of Python development where it\'s hard to stay in touch with what\'s going on. What would you like to see reports about? Two areas that have already been mentioned are Jython/JPython and the [PythonBusinessForum](PythonBusinessForum). What else is of burning interest? Who is going to give these reports? Sign up here and help to make [PyCon](PyCon) *relevant* and *engaging*. You don\'t need to be a professional speaker to help other Pythonistas out with a little information.

### Which Batteries? 

There seems to be some interest in building Python distributions that combine the core with various third-party libraries. [ActiveState](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ActiveState "Wiki") is probably the model here, packaging the Python core with Mark Hammond\'s win32all extensions and various others. How can this be done in ways that make more people\'s lives easier and at the same time assist the conference theme of ***Popularizing Python***?

### Choice of Freebies 

If sponsorship is available (as it appears it might be), should the organizers ask for money, to be used to reduce conference registration fees, or should they try to get nice giveaways that your technical friends will think are outrageously cool when you return home? Suggestions, please.

[ChoiceOfFreebies](ChoiceOfFreebies)

### Interested in Jython/J2EE track 

I believe there would be intense interest in a track related toPython/Jython\'s use in J2EE applications that utilize Bean Scripting Framework (BSF).

*That\'s great. It\'s a long time since I studied Beans, so clearly the Jythoneers will have to put this together. Maybe you and Matt Payne \[[Payne@MattPayne.org](mailto:Payne@MattPayne.org)\] could create a [PyConJython](PyConJython) page where the track details could be thrashed out and suitable authors could be press-ganged into submission? \-- steve*

### OpenSpace Track 

One of the problems in organizing a conference is knowing what people want to see and hear discussed. If the content is over-scheduled then we lose the ability to respond to the specific needs of the most important group: those who have taken the time and spent the money to attend. Consequently we plan to dedicate a significant amount of the time available to events that address the issues of importance *as decided at the conference*. Here\'s what Bob Payne had to say about [OpenSpace](OpenSpace) in his original comments:

Agile Universe in Chicago ran an [OpenSpace](OpenSpace) track and it was exciting and well attended [http://www.xpuniverse.com/openSpace](http://www.xpuniverse.com/openSpace). It is a straight forward way to get greater participation by all attendees. It is somewhat like BOF sessions but more dynamic and collaborative, with people negotiating slot times and combining/dividing talks. It has been called the XP of conference organization. One surprising result was that there were more testers in attendance than anyone expected, they essentially set up their own testing track in [OpenSpace](OpenSpace).

I have facilitated many training events and would be happy to facilitate such a track if people were interested. [BobPayne](./BobPayne.html) \[[bobpayne@webdc.com](mailto:bobpayne@webdc.com)\]

### Background 

The first annual Python community conference was [PyCon DC 2003](http://www.pycon.org/pastevents/dc2003), held at George Washington University\'s Cafritz Conference Center in Washington DC, from 26-28 March 2003. The major theme of the conference was ***Popularizing Python*** and it was a great success! A two-day \"sprint\" event was held before the conference with several teams working on different projects including the Python core, Twisted, Zope 3, and others.
