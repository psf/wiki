Author of [SkunkWeb](SkunkWeb).

Also recently wrote a program that can take a core dump file produced by a python interpreter and output a python stack trace. Very useful when you have a C extension that is misbehaving and you\'re not sure which one it is. Email me or the [SkunkWeb mailling list](mailto:skunkweb-list@lists.sourceforge.net){.mailto} if you\'re interested.
