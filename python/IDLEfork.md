# IDLEfork

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
The IDLEfork project has been completed. Since Python 2.3, [IDLE](IDLE) should be used instead of IDLEfork.

The IDLEfork project is an official experimental development fork of Python\'s small, light, \'bundled\' integrated development environment, [IDLE](IDLE). **In June 2003, the IDLEfork code base was merged back into Python 2.3.** More details can be found at [http://idlefork.sourceforge.net/](http://idlefork.sourceforge.net/){.http}.
