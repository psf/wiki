# Developers {#Developers}

Join the [centralva@python.org](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva){.http} mailing list, introduce yourself, ask questions, share your interests, and propose a meetup.

See the mailing list and promote meetup ideas.

# Recruiters {#Recruiters}

If you\'re a recruiter looking for Python developers, you are one of many. You are welcome to send mail to Python developers in Central VA at [centralva@python.org](mailto:centralva@python.org){.mailto} , a private moderated list. However, note that you\'ll have better success meeting and networking with Python developers than simply blasting out a job posting.

If you are a Python developer looking for a job, see the list archives for postings and get in touch with PyCHO members through the mailing list (or try contacting the organizer).

# Discussion and Questions {#Discussion_and_Questions}

- mailing list: [centralva@python.org](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva){.http} (subscribe [here](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva){.http})

- mailing list archives are available to subscribers [here](http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/centralva/){.http}

- PyCHO was created by [Ron DuPlain](mailto:ron.duplain@gmail.com){.mailto}. As of October 2013, the group is now being run by [Andrew Montalenti](mailto:ajm@pixelmonkey.org){.mailto}. Feel free to email him with questions or ideas about the local Python user group. Try the mailing list first. For questions on Python (and you\'re local), use the mailing list.
