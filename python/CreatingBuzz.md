IMHO better target specialized audience like Zope/WebApplicationServer, .NET etc. with targeted messages in newsgroups with [PyCon](PyCon) track referencies. Disclaimer: I\'m nor Zope, nor .NET user. \-- [MikeRovner](MikeRovner) 2003-12-06 00:32:20

The FOSDEM conference runs brief interviews with various presenters. See [http://lwn.net/Articles/63094/](http://lwn.net/Articles/63094/){.http} for links to three of them. It would be an excellent idea to do the same for [PyCon](PyCon). We should also set up a link to all blogs covering [PyCon](PyCon) while it\'s happening. \--amk

Press releases are still a good idea. See [PyCon2004PressRelease](./PyCon2004PressRelease.html){.nonexistent}. \--[StephanDeibel](StephanDeibel)
