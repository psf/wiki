Here is what people are asking for:

- Twisted - The most requested subject in 07. How do you explain twisted in one session?
- Basic Python - a subset of the core language elements. Cover the import command, but don\'t cover any modules. Scope, lists vs tuple\... that stuff, but don\'t cover lambda and other things that would make someones head explode.
- Python for Java programmers
- Under the hood of Python - or what ever you want to call the interaction between = and \_\_eq\_\_() and all the other things listed here: [http://docs.python.org/ref/customization.html](http://docs.python.org/ref/customization.html){.http .reference .external}
- Python\'s Dark Magic - the pros and cons of messing with \_\_magic\_\_()
