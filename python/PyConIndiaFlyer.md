## PyCon India 2009 {#PyCon_India_2009}

The first Programmers conference specifically devoted to the Python language is being held in Bangalore this September. We invite you all to join, benefit and make the event a success.

## What is PyCon? {#What_is_PyCon.3F}

[PyCon](PyCon) is a volunteer driven conference specifically focussing on all aspects of the Python language and it\'s community. [PyCons](./PyCons.html){.nonexistent} are held throughout the world and all of them are organised by volunteers passionate about the language and their community. This is first time a [PyCon](PyCon) is being held in India and it promises to be a fun filled two days of all things Python.

We deliberately keep the registration fees and other expenses low to maximise participation. This is a community event aimed at growing the Python community in India.

## What is Python? {#What_is_Python.3F}

Python is a very high level dynamically typed programming language that is growing very rapidly in the corporate and open source spheres.

It\'s emphasis on cleanliness and programmer productivity has won it many admirers. Large companies like Google, Rackspace, Industrial Light and Magic, Youtube etc. use Python in their core applications.

A large number of powerful Open Source applications like Zope, Mailman etc. are built using Python and have active development communities around them.

Whether you\'re looking for an opportunity to develop your technical skills or to further your career opportunities, Python is something you should be aware about.
