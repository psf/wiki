**[Buildout](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout)** is a \"system for managing development buildouts\".

While often identified as a [Zope](Zope) project, and indeed licensed under the [ZPL](./ZPL.html) by Zope creator [Jim Fulton](./Jim(20)Fulton.html), **buildout** is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases, a few that have nothing to do with [Python](Python). The home page includes extensive documentation, examples, and more.

At one level, buildout (still referred to as \"zc.buildout\" on occasion) manages [egg](egg)s.

Other treatments of **buildout** include:

- [Martin Aspelli](./Martin(20)Aspelli.html)\'s book on [Plone](Plone) 3, which includes a good reference on **buildout**;

- the Zope 3 Wiki includes a [useful page](http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/UsingBuildout) on the subject;

- Jim wrote a [tutorial](http://grok.zope.org/minitutorials/buildout.html);

- [Tutorial class for PyCon 2008](./buildout(2f)pycon2008(20)tutorial.html)

A proposal is being floated to create a more professional site for buildout. At a first step, let\'s [collect notes](./buildout(2f)newsite(20)notes.html) on what such a site would contain.
