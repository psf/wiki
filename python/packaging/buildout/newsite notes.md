# Rough Notes on a Possible Website for buildout ( [http://www.buildout.org/](http://www.buildout.org/) )

Objectives:

> - to give buildout a more professional face on the web
> - to raise the awareness of the buildout tool within the Python community
> - to improve and aggregate the documentation in a more friendly form
> - to provide a one-stop resource for learning about buildout recipes

Site Outline:

> - what is it, in a nutshell?
>
> - list of features
>
> - list of recipes
>
> - success stories
>
> - status box re version and stability
>
> - 
>
>   how-to installation
>
>   :   - easy_install zc.buildout
>
> - 
>
>   resources
>
>   :   - manual(s)
>       - screencasts that teach usage
>       - mailing lists
>       - IRC hangout
>       - a wiki? or use wiki.zope.org/buildout?
>       - ptr to issue tracker
>       - ptr to the buildout subversion repository
>       - set of tutorial stories re specific recipes and situations

Approach:

> - host it on a community machine, perhaps where Zope Foundation is now
> - base it on a Zope 3 site installation
> - rely upon contributed documents written in reStructuredText
