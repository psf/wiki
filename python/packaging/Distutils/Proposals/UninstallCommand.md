# Rationale 

The ability to uninstall packages installed by the install command is a long-time waited feature for distutils/setuptools. This document describe the design and features of such a facility.

An uninstall feature should be implemented for both distutils and setuptools: the setuptools uninstall command would then reuse the distutils one.

What should be the behavior of an uninstall command ?

- pure distutils (wo setuptools): only remove files installed by the install command from the same source tree.
- setuptools: should be able to remove eggs, deal with .pth.
- easy_install: may remove the dependencies (ala apt-get autoremove).

# distutils command 

Problems to solve:

- how to record the files installed
- where to put the generated list of files
- how to decide which package location to remove

Possible solutions:

## How to record the files installed 

use the same facility as install \--record to record the list of files to remove

## Where to put the generated list 

The list itself should be put in .egg-info (since it is built by both distutils and setuptools install command). The problem is how to get access to this list when several packages are installed (e.g. different site-packages, user vs system package, etc\...). Several possible solutions:

- uninstall would take a record option, using the file generated by install \--record. Can be a first step.
- put the location of the record in the build directory: hosed when the build directory is removed. But easy to get previously-installed location
- In the source tree itself ? Invasive. Easy to get last-installed location.

Removing last installed version is a useful feature for people who follow some projects from svn, and get caught when some modules are renamed inside the package.

Maybe another useful features:

- python setup.py uninstall \--prefix=path -\> should remove the package installed with python setup.py install \--prefix=path

- should be possible to avoid generating the record file (for OS distributors ?), although I am not sure whether this is useful. The rationale would be to avoid removing a system-wide package by accident. On OS with proper user protection, it won\'t be possible to do anything, and on windows, it is no worse than removing by rd-like commands, and requires the same effort.

# setuptools command 

- should deal with eggs, versions ?
- ability to remove a specified version

# easy_install command 

- based on setuptools uninstall

# Central management for packages 

A nice solution may be for python to have a centralized system to record installed packages. But how to deal with user python vs system python ? Putting some info into \$HOME or equivalent cannot accomodate multiple python interpreters installed by users; putting them into a location \'owned\' by the python interpreter is not usable when the python is system wide. More than likely to be hard to agree on implementation.
