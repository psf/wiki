**Building Python from source on Ubuntu**

The following packages are required install to get a complete build on Ubuntu.

- libbz2-dev
- libgdbm-dev
- liblzma-dev
- libreadline-dev
- libsqlite3-dev
- libssl-dev
- tcl-dev
- tk-dev
- dpkg-dev (this should solve the \_crypt and nis failures)

zlib1g-dev isn\'t on the list as it gets installed automatically as a dependency of libssl-dev.
