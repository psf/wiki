## Applications in, of or with Python {#Applications_in.2C_of_or_with_Python}

This page lists application-related ideas.

- Research how to get python support into all the cheap webhosts.

- Write a new and useful application in Python.

- Improve an existing Python application (e.g. [Mailman](http://wiki.list.org/display/DEV/Summer+of+Code){.http}, [BitTorrent](./BitTorrent.html){.nonexistent}, Zope). Some Python-based projects are SoC mentoring organizations in their own right, so you might end up being mentored by them, not the PSF. (You should probably contact a current developer on the project first, to ensure that your plans mesh with theirs. JimJJewett offers to help if you want to work on [plucker](http://www.plkr.org){.http}, which lets you read web pages on a disconnected palm pilot.)

- [PyxIDE](http://pyxides.stani.be/){.http} has several potential projects related to IDEs in Python. Real-time code analysis would be a good project (which could in turn be used to build auto-completion and other tools).

- Improve support for Python in Eclipse (the Java-based integrated development environment): [http://pydev.sf.net](http://pydev.sf.net){.http}

- Improved python code generation support in umbrello [http://uml.sourceforge.net/index.php](http://uml.sourceforge.net/index.php){.http} or alternatively a pure python implementation to parse umbrello files and generate python code.

- Bring [MayaVi 2\'s](http://www.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/MayaVi){.http} feature set up to the level of [MayaVi 1.5](http://mayavi.sourceforge.net){.http} ([contact](mailto:robert.kern@enthought.com){.mailto}).

- integrate Bayesian Filtering with [MoinMoin](MoinMoin). see: [full proposal](http://gauss.ffii.org/BayesWiki){.http}

  - isn\'t this better under the [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) mentors? see below..

- [pywinauto](http://pywinauto.pbwiki.com/){.http}

  - Create tool to allow macro recording (possibly using pyAA or pyHook - or other tools).
  - Research how one pywinauto script can work on any number of (spoken) languages.

- [Stars](http://regal.sdsu.edu/stars){.http}

  - Space Time Analysis of Regional Systems
  - Assist with the refactoring of this program\... Tasks include, visualization, interaction and data structures.

- Improve [GRAC](http://grac.sourceforge.net/){.http}, a GRAmmar Checker based on learning algorithms.

- Improve [http://sourceforge.net/projects/shedskin/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/shedskin/){.http}, an optimizing Python-to-C++ compiler, that typically results in code that is 2-40 times faster than when using Psyco. A nice SoC topic would be to add memory optimizations (such as transforming heap allocation into stack- and static preallocation), to bring the performance of generated code even closer to that of manually written C++.
