# Python and Databases Brainstorm {#Python_and_Databases_Brainstorm}

## Pamphlet {#Pamphlet}

This is where we need to settle on what to cover in the flyer. We need to keep it concise because there is not much room. Here are the topics I think are relevant:

- *Almost* any serious program needs persistent storage of some type.

- The Python DBI gives a consistent look and feel to most databases.

- A brief example on connecting to and calling a database.

- Something about speed vs. C/C++ or Java?
