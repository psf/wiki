This list is by no means complete, we\'re still getting our mentors lined up for this program and are waiting for confirmation to be a mentoring org before setting up all the 3rd party projects that have been a bulk of our students in past years GSoC/GHOP.

# Adding new tasks {#Adding_new_tasks}

Add new tasks only in the above 8 categories.

Within each category tasks should sorted by experience level:

1.  Novice - these tasks can be done by someone with no experience working with the project
2.  Median - these tasks are suitable for someone with some experience in a project
3.  Expert - these tasks require knowledge in a specific field or extreme familiarity with a project

Task ideas should be tagged with the subproject they should be mentored for, currently:

- stdlib - Python\'s Standard Library
- packaging - The distutils (stdlib) or distutils2 projects
- wsgi - Web Service Gateway Interface and related packages
