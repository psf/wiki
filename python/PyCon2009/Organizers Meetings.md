**Next meeting**: Tuesday, March 25, at 19:00 UTC (2PM Eastern, 1PM Central, 12PM Mountain, 11AM Pacific).

**Update:** Some people are already on-site, others are on their way, so there won\'t be a formal meeting. But some people will be online.

Meetings will be held every week on Tuesday.

Meetings are held via IRC. We use the \'#pycon\' channel on irc.freenode.net. [Connection details (instructions) here](./PyCon(2f)Organizers_Meetings_Connection_Details.html){.nonexistent .reference .external}.
