# PortablePython

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
\"[Portable Python](http://www.portablepython.com/){.http}\" is a distribution of the Python programming language that

- can be run without installing it.
- from a USB drive, for example.
- includes many extras such as different IDEs, wxPython, etc.
- the exact set of extras available depends on the version of Python.
- can be obtained for Python 2.5, 2.6, or Python 3.0.
- is only available for Windows.

According to their official [website](http://www.portablepython.com/){.http}, this distribution is not being developed anymore. However, the website is still worth a visit as they list several alternatives such as Anaconda that largely fulfill the same purpose.

If it interests you, another analogous distribution is [MovablePython](MovablePython).
