### Potential plans for the EmailSigSprint {#Potential_plans_for_the_EmailSigSprint}

Here are some things we could do during an email sprint. I\'m not sure whether there is 4 days worth of work here, or just two.

- Design the API for email v3.0
- Implementation of email 3.0 changes
- Fix references to codecs (i.e. CJKCodecs issue)
- Design and implement a new parser
- Implement support for more RFCs
- Write a suite of email address validators that doesn\'t depend on rfc822.py and is more consistent with RFC 2822.
- Other topics?
