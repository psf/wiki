### InTheirOwnWords {#InTheirOwnWords}

maki is a webserving framework built on Python and XML. It allows a web developer to send an XML input document through any number of steps, where each step is either a stylesheet transformation or a custom process. A processor that evaluates embedded Python code is included. The output of each step is passed as the input to the next step (similar to a Unix pipe). Additionally, the output of each processor step can be cached for a user-specified time period. All configuration is done in XML files that allow you to specify rules based on matching paths against Unix-style wildcard patterns or regular expressions.
