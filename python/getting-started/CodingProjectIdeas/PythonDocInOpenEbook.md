# CodingProjectIdeas/PythonDocInOpenEbook

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).

Python documentation should be available in Wikipedia:OpenEbook and Wikipedia:MicrosoftReader formats. This would be nice for studying python on PDAs.
