## Python Examples and Sample Code 

When you\'re learning, small examples can be very helpful.

- [The Python Standard Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017142948/http://effbot.org/zone/librarybook-index.htm) (archived copy), an electronically published book by Fredrik Lundh, examines most of the modules in Python\'s standard library, describing what the module does and giving a short example of its use. Note that this book is now relatively old and so misses a lot of the developments of the last two decades.

- The [Python Recipes](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/), from [ActiveState](ActiveState), is a very large collection of code snippets, some elementary and some advanced.
