wxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create WxWidgets/ [WxPython](WxPython) user interfaces. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and XRC ([WxWidgets](WxWidgets)\' XML resources) code.

As you can guess by the name, its model is Glade, the famous GTK+/GNOME GUI builder, with which wxGlade shares the philosophy and the look & feel (but not a line of code).

It is not (and will never be) a full featured IDE, but simply a \"designer\": the generated code does nothing apart from displaying the created widgets. If you are looking for a complete IDE, maybe [BoaConstructor](BoaConstructor) or [PythonCard](./PythonCard.html) is the right tool.
