## Jesse Weinstein 

I\'m a Python hacker(in the good sense), currently mainly on Mac OS X. I have other homepages at: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JesseW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JesseW) and [http://netwood.net/usr/jessw](http://netwood.net/usr/jessw)

You can email me via the Wikipedia homepage, or just modify this page.
