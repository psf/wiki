In order for [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) to have a large attendance, the word must get out. This page is meant to contain a rough list of sites/lists/people/etc. that should be kept abreast of [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) planning in order to help promote the conference. Also any other general notes should go on this page.

IMHO better target specialized audience like Zope/WebApplicationServer, .NET etc. with targeted messages in newsgroups with [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) track referencies. Disclaimer: I\'m nor Zope, nor .NET user. \-- [MikeRovner](MikeRovner) 2003-12-06 00:32:20

The FOSDEM conference runs brief interviews with various presenters. See [http://lwn.net/Articles/63094/](http://lwn.net/Articles/63094/) for links to three of them. It would be an excellent idea to do the same for [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon). We should also set up a link to all blogs covering [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) while it\'s happening. \--amk

Press releases are still a good idea. See [PyCon2004PressRelease](./PyCon2004PressRelease.html). \--[StephanDeibel](StephanDeibel)
