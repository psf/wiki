## Common Ideas 

This page lists ideas that have been discussed frequently or at great length. Its goals are

- to help contributors of ideas to easily evaluate their ideas compared with similar past proposals,
- to help readers of giant ideas threads by providing summaries of the most salient points,
- to help PEP writers who have decided to take the leap and propose one of these ideas by providing some of the text for the PEP, and
- to help people responding to ideas by giving them a quick response thereby saving them the trouble of regenerating old discussions.

Commonly proposed ideas:

- [Multi-line anonymous function](MultiLineLambda)

- [OrderedSet](./OrderedSet.html)

- [Abbreviated keyword arguments](./AbbreviatedKeywordArguments.html)
