# Version Control 

The following applications related to version/revision control are written in Python:

## Version Control Systems 

- [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) (formerly Bazaar-NG)

- [Codeville](http://codeville.org/)

- [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/)

## Abstraction Layers and Tools 

Tools with unified interface to several version control systems.

- [Hg-Git](http://hg-git.github.com/) - access Git repositories from Mercurial

- [pysync](http://code.google.com/p/pysync/) - abstraction layer, looks inactive, but a lot of commits

- [pyvcs (Alex Gaynor and co.)](https://github.com/alex/pyvcs) - pure python abstraction layer of multiple VCS, very lightweight

- [vcs](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vcs/) - another abstraction layer, seems to be MIT licensed

## Migration Tools 

- [cvs2svn](http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/) - the CVS to Subversion repository converter

- [Tailor](http://progetti.arstecnica.it/tailor) - a tool to migrate changesets between ArX, Bazaar, Bazaar-NG, CVS, Codeville, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, Subversion and Tla repositories

## Repository Browsers 

- [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) supports repository browsing

- [ViewVC](http://www.viewvc.org/) (formerly ViewCVS) - a repository browser for CVS and Subversion
