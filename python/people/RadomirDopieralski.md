Hello there. I\'m mostly lurker here, but after some attempts to contact someone in charge of this wiki through different means, I finally decided to try the most straightforward approach and just write the message here.

This wiki\'s theme is a custom work, made to fit the rest of python.org website. Unfortunately, the theme was made some time ago, for an older version of [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) and in the mean time there wer some changes\... That\'s why when the Europython guys wanted to use that theme, I made a new version, also using the graphics from the python.org site, but basic the theme on one of the default [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) themes which are updated together with [MoinMoin](MoinMoin). You can see the theme in action at [http://wiki.europython.eu/](http://wiki.europython.eu/) and you can get it at [http://devel.sheep.art.pl/europython/archive/tip.tar.gz](http://devel.sheep.art.pl/europython/archive/tip.tar.gz) if you want to use it for this wiki. We are always very happy to help on the #moin channel on freenode. \-- 68.183.240.26 2009-06-20 04:05:04

I\'ve sent a mail to the [Pydotorg mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pydotorg) telling the members about this offer. \-- [PaulBoddie](PaulBoddie) 2009-06-21 20:58:56
