Hi.

I\'m interested in how Python can be used in various ways - as a tool in various software development environments (ones that do not necessarily involve Python). Included in this are

\- Python as an object oriented language in conjunction with other object oriented environments such as J2EE-Spring-Hibernate, Ruby and including design patterns. - Python as a functional programming language in conjunction with other languages such as Lisp, Haskel and Scheme. - Using Python in real application environments that involve Web 2.0, Web Services, database, and scripting.
