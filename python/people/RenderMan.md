A generalized standard for 3d animation rendering systems, originally created by Pixar. Often confused with Pixar\'s Photorealistic Renderman software, the term Renderman actually refers to a set of file formats and other conventions that otherwise divergent rendering system could use. It is intended to be \"the postscript of 3d\".
