# Description 

This is a response to the page wanting [Powerful Python One-Liners](./Powerful(20)Python(20)One(2d)Liners.html).\" It prints the user\'s platform to the screen. It is something that I felt would be a good start for the [Powerful Python One-Liners](./Powerful(20)Python(20)One(2d)Liners.html).

# Code 

`from sys import platform; print platform`
