### Brief Bio 

Working as a software engineer, *in both contract and permanent roles*, since 1987 but with an interest in computers since the 1970s I have mostly worked designing, developing, maintaining, researching, training & testing in the embedded & safety critical industries including:

- Flight Simulation *(PL/M-86/286/489, C, FORTRAN, Assembler)*

- Telecommunications & Cable TV *(C++, C, Pascal)*

- Defense *(C, C++, Corel-66, FORTRAN, BASIC)*

- Avionics *(Java, C, XML, XSL, CSS, HTML, Test Scripting, Python, Assembler, Test Scripting)*

- Sonar *(Python, C, Pascal, Delphi, PL/M-286, DSP)*

- Rail Infrastructure *(C, Assembler)*

- Oil & Gas *(Python, Jupyter, C, C++, VB6, Assembler)*

I am familiar with target & development systems ranging from those with no OS (bare metal), through those that need to be booted from paper tape, desktop machines and mainframes - from single chips to pipelines & clusters with 100s of processors.

I am an occasional conference attendee at PyConUK & [EuroPython](EuroPython).
