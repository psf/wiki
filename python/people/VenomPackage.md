### Suitability 

Venom is a project [JürgenHermann](./J(c3bc)rgenHermann.html) did not come around to activating yet, but its intention is to collect generic, top-quality \"functionality\". Venom\'s scope is un-specific functions that can be useful for any other project. For easy re-use, major goals are extensive documentation and unit tests.

It could thus serve as a breeding ground for future standard library modules.

### Comments 

2004/04/15: The home page for Venom seems to suggest that it is specialized for 3-D graphics applications, not a general-purpose tool. (A. Lloyd Flanagan, alloydflanagan at comcast dot net)
