Software which is distributed for zero price is often termed \"free\", but that English word is also associated with liberty. A definition for [Free Software](FreeSoftware) already exists; it is confusing to use the word \"free\" to refer to a restrictively-licensed program that merely has a zero price tag.

Note that whether a particular program is zero cost is a function of an individual act of distribution \-- the same identical program may be distributed to different people, or at different times, for various prices, including zero.

In contrast, whether a program is [Free Software](FreeSoftware) is a function of whether its users are able to exercise their freedoms.
