## How to Help Python 

There are tons of ways you can help out Python and the associated community. Because Python is a community project, there\'s very little structure; you just have to find an area you\'re interested in and dive in! Money is good, but time is even more precious; contribute your time to Python today!

Here are a few ideas:

\- [Help out with core Python development](CoreDevelopment) by reviewing patches and fixing bugs.

\- Proofread, edit, and extend the [documentation](http://www.python.org/dev/doc/)

\- Join a [local user group](../community/LocalUserGroups) and encourage other people you know to attend.

\- [Volunteer](http://www.python.org/psf/volunteer/) to help out the Python Software Foundation!

\- Blog about your own Pythonic endeavors and syndicate your blog on [planet.python.org](http://planet.python.org/) and [planetpython.org](http://planetpython.org/).

\- Participate in the Google Summer of Code or the Google Highly Open Participation contest as a mentor or a student.

\- Download interesting packages from the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi), install them, and test them out.

\- Help porting python [modules and software](../py3/Python3PortingStatus) or [operating system depencies](../py3/Python3LinuxDistroPortingStatus) from Python 2 to Python 3. This is a serious issue as [the last Python 2 release happens in 2020](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#release-schedule).
