# About 

I am one of the core developers of the [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) Python Wiki Engine (also used here).

I fell in love with wikis some years ago (and decided for [MoinMoin](MoinMoin), written by [JürgenHermann](./J(c3bc)rgenHermann.html), as it looked like the best engine at that time).

Soon I began hacking the [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) code and thus fell in love with Python, too. I heard of Python before, but never had a deeper look as I didn\'t feel like learning \"just another script language\". Felt a bit dumb, though, after discovering what a clean, powerful and *productive* language it is and asked myself why I didn\'t discover that great language earlier. I coded in quite some different languages, but Python beats them all.

Meanwhile I avoid doing coding in any other language if it can be done in Python, too.

# Contact 

I usually hang around on #moin IRC channel on irc.freenode.net, so if you need any [MoinMoin](MoinMoin) help, feel free to contact me there.

My (mostly german) wiki homepage is at [ThomasWaldmann](http://linuxwiki.org/ThomasWaldmann "LinuxWiki") - there is also my email address.
