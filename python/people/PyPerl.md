pyperl is a module for integrating Perl in Python.

See:

- [PyPerl at ASPN](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Modules/dist_html?dist_id=10617)

- [perlmodule documentation at ASPN](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/CodeDoc/pyperl/perlmodule.html)

- [Download latest PyPerl module](http://downloads.activestate.com/Zope-Perl/)

- pyperl is currently unmaintained. There is an unofficial version distributed by Felix Schwarz named [1.0.1c](http://www.felix-schwarz.name/files/opensource/pyperl/) which fixes some compilation errors on newer systems.

\* Recent patches by Per Øyvind Karlsen with fixes for python 2.5 as well as some other useful stuff is available at [Mandriva SVN](http://svn.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/packages/cooker/python-perlmodule/)
