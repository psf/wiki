Mohammad is an Iranian who grew up loving programming and typography. In high school, he was introduced to data structures and algorithms, and after a couple years of studying these concepts, he ended up pursuing a computer engineering B.Sc program. It was around this time when he found about the true way of Unix, as well as Free Software, GNU. My aspirations and goals are to combine my technical skills with business and leadership experiences in order to become a well-rounded professional in the world of business and technology
