# Welcome to the LeeEdwin/DownloadCenter 

Here you can find some downloads of different programs that I have written. I will post new programs every now and then. Each program has its own page, because there are many versions of each program. Especially if it is an entire package of programs. I hope that you find these programs useful. Thank you for visiting this Wiki page and have a great day! ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)")

## Math Tools Series 

The math tools series is a set of programs that I have written that create an I/O interface for the math modules many different functions. I am just now putting in on the Wiki and it is not very advanced yet. I hope to make it a lot more advanced. You can download it at the [LeeEdwin/MathTools](./LeeEdwin(2f)MathTools.html) page.
