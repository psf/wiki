### Last minute helper mob

We\'ll probably need people here and there to help out, if we can call you or sms message you, that would be great. Sign up by following the [http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers](http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers) twitter channel. Calls for mob-like volunteer opportunities will go out as the need arises.
