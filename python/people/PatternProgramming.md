# Pattern Programming 

*I believe we should defer to C2 for the main ideas about Patterns. I believe we should apply the [BridgePattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BridgePattern "Wiki"). Use C2 to describe the pattern itself, and then show it here in it\'s Python-specific glory. There\'s seems to be little point in attempting to recreate the depth of C2 here.*
