I am a former student of [JeffreyElkner](JeffreyElkner) who initially taught me python in 2001. I now use python daily for work on CanDo, an online competency tracking software built on SchoolTool and Zope3.

I am currently a Sophomore at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. My studies include mostly applied mathematics with a twist of pure mathematics zest.
