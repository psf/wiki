SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on standard [Python](Python) and released under the GNU LGPL.

It provides the modeller with components of a simulation model. These include **processes**, for active components like customers, messages, and vehicles, and **resources**, for passive components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. It also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering statistics.
