The CanDo project [http://cando.schooltool.org](http://cando.schooltool.org) is an open source Competency Tracking application built on [SchoolTool](SchoolTool) [http://schooltool.org](http://schooltool.org) which serves as a competency grade book, journaling system, and curriculum delivery tool.

The long term goal is to use CanDo to enable students to create competency portfolios that they can build throughout their educational process.

The project is now in its third year of development and will be deployed in a statewide pilot program next year in Virginia.
