Python is used for developing on-line systems for the floor of the exchange and for the member firm\'s back offices. It has been nearly four years ago since it was introduced and there are now about ten developers working full time with this language. Management here were quick to realize the speed and lower costs of development. Now years down the road they acknowledge its low maintenence costs. The language is used in the core of NYSE\'s first internet project that ever went live. This project is now one of their biggest services - their biggest internet based service by a long way. We use [pso](pso), also see [WebProgramming](WebProgramming). We try to keep things simple, but commercial and political pressure from business management and ignorant young blood for java is impossible to oppose.
