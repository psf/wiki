# VolunteerOpportunities

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

## Volunteer Opportunities in Python 

The purpose of this page is to act as an adjunct to the [Python Jobs](http://www.python.org/community/jobs/) page, which only allows the posting of paying jobs.

This page is dedicated to volunteer opportunities that are not necessarily any different from any other \"real\" job, except for the fact that the work is not done for pay. There\'s a separate page with information if you want to [volunteer to help the PSF](http://www.python.org/psf/volunteer/).

### How To Submit a Volunteer Job 

There is already a [Python Jobs \[\[HowTo](http://www.python.org/community/jobs/howto/)\]\] page, and it would be best if you could follow those same instructions as closely as possible for this page. Doing so will allow people who are already familiar with this site to access the material quickly. (However, edit this page instead of submitting your position to the Job Board, we just want similar formatting.) Please include a posting date - historically most submitters don\'t swing back and update this page when things change, adding a date provides some indicator of freshness for both volunteers and editors.

## POR Game Emulator 

Our current team of 16 is looking for some python developers to assist us in developing a game emulator for a game called Pirates Online Retribution; We are lucky enough to have the original devloper\'s approved source code and are working on rewriting the code, but are in need of some quality python developers to assist in speeding up the process. While we are looking for volunteers, benefits of the game and likely monetary rewards will be distributed upon the project\'s completion.

For more information Contact me by email or my supervisor via skype: email: [breedyofficial@gmail.com](mailto:breedyofficial@gmail.com) skype: ilovebella991

## Sharamag ePublishing. 

**Job Description**: Developers are needed to work on the database portions of an open-use epublishing concept. The current version is similar to a blog in that people can write & construct articles, as well as collect articles to create issues of publications. Final rendition will have dedicated readers to each platform (iphone, android devices, ipad, tablet systems) that display the created content in a way best suited for that device. The back end of this system is currently targeted to Google App Engine for the scalability.

The concept is to build an open community for publishing on electronic devices where the creation of content is as easy as writing a blog entry. Contributors and collaborators will be able to work together towards creating issues of publications, and those publications will be readable on any device without having to download a complete application for every issue. This idea came about because of the barriers to publishing on electronic devices such as the ipad and more capable mobile phones.

**What Python is used for**: Currently for database construction and manipulation, article entries, eventually including a visualizer for layout & design.

## Pinwheel.org ! 

We need your help!

Pinwheel.org is a web-based network that connects student volunteers and non-profit agencies. We want to show volunteers they can do things they enjoy to give back, help schools become more engaged in their students\' volunteer work, and allow non-profits to manage their work force more effectively. The service is free for volunteers and opportunity posters. Please see our temporary site: www.Pinwheel.org/

Originally co-founded at Stanford by a group of students, Pinwheel is now a pioneering force in the business world, nonprofit world, and worlds of students all over the country. After the Beta launch, Pinwheel will be the first resource for high school students looking for volunteer work.

The application that drives the Pinwheel web site is written in Python, and we are seeking developers who are familiar with that language.

Required Knowledge and Skills

- Experience writing xhtml
- Experience using Macromedia Fireworks or Adobe Photoshop
- Experience writing and debugging code in a web programming language (PHP, Perl, ASP, Java, Python or Ruby)
- Knowledge of web standards, specifically the xhtml transitional 1.0 specification and CSS2
- Knowledge of object oriented software development (equivalent to a freshman course in computer programming)
- Interns must be: teamwork-oriented, self-motivated, proud of Pinwheel\'s vision, idealistic, and fun-loving(!) -just like we are.

We\'ve spent the last 2 years working hard on this idea, and want to get it up and running ASAP. Ideally, you will work in our office in San Francisco, but we are flexible, and could allow programmers to work from Palo Alto or at home. Please contact [exec@pinwheel.org](mailto:exec@pinwheel.org) Thanks!

## PyConference 

**Conference planning web application plus appropriate frontend (conference website).**

I don\'t know if you know it, but there is an very good conference planning software written in Ruby on Rails, called \"Pentabarf\" - [http://www.pentabarf.org/Main_Page](http://www.pentabarf.org/Main_Page) - and I really would like to see it if we have something like that in python, too.

Its not a \"NIH\"-thing, but I am more into Python than into Ruby, as the most of you. And a second reason for starting such a project is especially the planning of python-focused confernces. There it would be a little be embarassing, if someone plans a conference in a RoR conference planning web application or - much worser ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)") - in PHP.

And using a half-baked Plone or Zope application wouldnt do the job right, also not the using of a wiki like [MoinMoin](MoinMoin), it isnt the right tool for such a job.

I didn\'t start the project yet, but if there are enough people for a good team I would start and host it.

Ruby has a good web framework doing this, Ruby on Rails. But we got two! ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":)")

## E Screening Room (San Rafael, CA, USA) 

**Job Description:** This is not for the faint of heart ! If you have time to hammer this out in the next three weeks let us know\... We will be building an integration of \"Broadcast Machine\" with Paypal subscription services.\*

We are looking for a volunteer web developer with a passion for documentary films and in support of the freedom of speech, with experience with perl, Python mysql. We are using agile (extreme) programming methods. We can\'t pay you anything but you get to create the cool feature to support the freedom of speech.

The non-profit [E Screening Room](http://www.escreeningroom.org) is dedicated to connect independent documentary film makers with their audience. We have on-line website dedicated to viewing unabridged independent documentary films at [http://escreeningroom.org](http://escreeningroom.org). We are starting a new website [http://indiewebfest.org](http://indiewebfest.org) which will be an online filmfestival based running on open source \"Broadcast Machine\" from [http://www.getdemocracy.com/broadcast/](http://www.getdemocracy.com/broadcast/). The neat thing of the \"Broadcast Machine\" is that it is bittorrent based, and thus allows for unlimited band wide without significant funding. In effect this means that you don\'t have to come up with thousands of \$\$ to distribute your idea or your film.

Independent documentary films are born out of the passion -often compassion - for the subject of the film. Often these documentaries are self financed. But there is little financial gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field. We think that\'s a shame: to lose an independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we are changing that by connecting documentary filmmakers with their audience.

**Project:** The idea is to allow viewers to subscribe to a site through paypal. The viewer would pay a low monthly fee to get assess to a subset (subscription only) of the films on the site. The subscription fees are then redistributed to the filmmakers papal accounts based on viewer ship and will fund the site. This project will take place independent of getdemocracy.com but application will be released as open source. I expect that it will take about 40 hour over two months.

## Video display hooks needed for off\--screen model. 

As many of you may or may not know, there is a freeware open-source screen reader for blind and visually impaired people written in Python called NVDA (Nonvisual Desktop Access.) The software runs on Windows2000, xp (all versions) and vista. The project is coming along quickly however we need video display hooks to create an off-screen model so that NVDA can give more information to the blind computer user, and also implement such things as mouse simulation. Video display hooks will also allow us to support even more applications and enhance the support of the current applications even more-so. These video display hooks for the offscreen model need to be written in Python if possible. To download NVDA, go to

[http://www.nvda-project.org](http://www.nvda-project.org)

We as developers and testers haven\'t been able to figure out how to implement video display hooks so NVDA can utilise an off-screen model so far. Any help would be greatly appreciated. You may contact me about this project at Josh Kennedy [jkenn337@gmail.com](mailto:jkenn337@gmail.com) msn messenger contact: Josh Kennedy [kenn6498ku@hotmail.com](mailto:kenn6498ku@hotmail.com) skype contact: jkenn337

Again any assistance with this project would be greatly apreciated. Video display hooks will greatly increase the abilities of the NVDA screen-reader. Note, this position is not restricted to blind programmers if you have sight and can help please contact me. There is also an email list for NVDA at [nvda@freelists.org](mailto:nvda@freelists.org) .
