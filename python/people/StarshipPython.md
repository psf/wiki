[Starship Python](http://starship.python.net/)

A site created by the Python community, run by the Python community, for the Python community. The actual machine and network connectivity are hosted by Zope Corporation. Many Python programmers have pages there, and many of them distribute code from their Starship pages.

As of August 2003, Starship Python is moving to a new home. See the [StarshipTransfer](StarshipTransfer) page for details and status updates.
