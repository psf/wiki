# Just Python

Basic Python - a subset of the core language elements. Cover the import command, but don\'t cover any modules. scope, lists vs tuple\... that stuff, but don\'t cover lambda and other things that would make someones head explode.

Python for Java programmers - It\'s similar, but different.

Python for (other language you know) - If you have experienced the transition, share it with others to make it easier for them.
