Building Python with the MS C Toolkit is not supported. The toolkit itself is difficult to find these days, since MS no longer supplies it.

For building 3.3 you can use Visual Studio 2010, and for previous versions (at least 2.6 and 2.7) you can use Visual Studio 2008, as per the proper devguide page you should refer to, at:

This page is left here mainly due to Google search results.
