# About 

My name is Frances Hocutt. I\'m working with [SumanaHarihareswara](SumanaHarihareswara) and Changeset Consulting to audit and update documentation (including this wiki) to prepare for the final stages of the Python 2-\>3 transition. I\'ve previously worked on [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org) and I use Python for personal projects and occasionally in my day job.
