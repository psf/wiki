An Emailer Daemon that allows 3rd Party Software to easily send emails by just generating a file And easily Seeing the result. Without the need to open up any ports and leave yourself open to attackers. Python source and frozen binaries provided.

I found a need to add email ability to my program that was stand alone and threaded. I have found that handling these emails in a sepearate system helps me with future coding projects that may need email ability. As I just have a module that knows how to build the correct file format.

This program comes with an installer that will do everything for you and have you up and running in a few minutes.
