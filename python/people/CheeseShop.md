## Trivia 

The secret code name refers to the [Cheese Shop sketch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch) performed and recorded by John Cleese and Michael Palin on 7 January 1972.

Whether that name was chosen because CPAN contains so many packages at that time remains in the dark zone of rumours and wild speculation.
