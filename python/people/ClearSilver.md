### Presentation Support 

ClearSilver is a templating system designed for HTML. Helps enforce split between presentation and application.

### InTheirOwnWords 

ClearSilver is a fast and powerful HTML templating system.

ClearSilver is language neutral, allowing you to seamlessly mix Ruby, C, C++, Python, Perl, Java, PHP, and any other programming language you use, all in the same site, or even the same page.

ClearSilver is fast, avoiding the problems created by language-specific template systems written in slow script languages such as Python or Perl.

ClearSilver is easy to use. Unlike XML/XSLT, which are complicated to setup and understand. You\'ll quickly find that ClearSilver is the easiest way to develop dynamic webpages.
