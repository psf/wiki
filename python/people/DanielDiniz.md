I\'m a Biologist (\'[crawling critters](http://photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=289293)\' kind, as opposed to \'molecules\' or \'plants\') with a tendency to perform small Python hacks.

Current Python interests involve [TrackerDevelopment](TrackerDevelopment) and [bug triaging](http://www.python.org/dev/workflow/).

I have a dormant [C code coverage](https://launchpad.net/ccoverage) project, inspired by some flaws found by [Fusil](http://fusil.hachoir.org/).
