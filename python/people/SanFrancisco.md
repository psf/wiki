## Budget 

- [Google Spreadsheet](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pW3nnFeV4LgDK1_K1JXvbaw)

- Basically the 2007 budget copied on 2/10

- Adjusted fixed costs to San Mateo figures

- The meals figure of \$150 per person includes 3 lunches and 6 breaks

- I do not know if it includes sodas and juices, if it does, we can eliminate \$13 per day

### Travel to Bay Area 

There is not just 1 major airport. There are 3 major airports in the SF Bay Area. All the discount airlines fly here with direct flights to major urban centers. [SouthWest](./SouthWest.html) and [JetBlue](./JetBlue.html) are starting service to San Francisco Airport this summer.

Airline Discounts - The conference organizers will negotiate a reduced fare from United Airlines and Southwest. Since we are not a major conference, it will probably be 5%. You can usually get that just by asking.

### From Airports to Hotel 

- [San Francisco](http://www.flysfo.com/) - Free Shuttle

- [Oakland](http://www.flyoakland.com/) - \$3 bus to [BART](http:www.bart.gov) to [SFO](http://www.flysfo.com/) - \$5.80

- [San Jose](http://www.sjc.org/) - Free [VTA shuttle](http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_10.html) to [Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com) - 2 blocks from hotel - \$3.75

### Main Tracks 

- Golden Gate Ballroom - 700 people
- Bay Bridge Room A/B - 260 people
- Bay Bridge Room C - 215 people
- Crystal springs room - 200 people
- AV is \$2400 for 3 days including onsite staff

### Additional Areas 

- Exhibit Area - Golden Gate Foyer - 39\'x39\'

- Presidio Room - Break Room - 5 tables of 8
- Lombard Room - 110 people - additional presentations

- Geary Room - Quiet Room - Laptop usage - 3 tables of 8
- Post Room - Quiet Room - Laptop usage - 3 tables of 8

### Internet Access 

\$5K for 3 days for 200 concurrent users. We can increase it since the hotel has more T1 lines. Nearby Foster City is completely covered by Free Wifi. San Mateo is covered by the Wireless Silicon Valley agreement and may be completely covered by Wifi by the time of the conference.

### 24 Hour Nerding 

We have all the conference rooms for all 4 days. We can have evening events like sprints, additional ad hoc discussions, etc.

### Speaker Benefits 

One of the biggest advantages of the Bay Area is that we can get speakers that might not be willing to travel for a Python convention but would be perfectly willing to drive. For example, Ebay, Google, Amazon, Yahoo, etc have API\'s that can be used by Python. They would be willing to drive but might be unwilling to fly.

### Outreach Opportunity 

There will be additional meeting rooms available. There are many interesting Python projects that could use some corporate support. We can arrange presentations for companies of using your project.

### Transit 

[BART](http://www.bart.gov) The subway system from the Bay Area

[Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com) - Commuter train takes you from SF to the [Gilroy Outlet Shopping](http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=23)

### Volunteers 

There is already a list of a dozen local people that have volunteered to help. Personally, I live 4 miles from the hotel and can accept shipments. [BayPiggies](BayPiggies) has a email list of several hundred people that can potentially help.

### If you have never been to the San Francisco Bay area 

[map here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=sfo&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=9&ll=37.712072,-122.453613&spn=1.047287,2.936096) It is about 60 miles from San Francisco to San Jose.

San Jose and area is what is know as Silicon Valley. All the tech you could possibly be interested in is here. It would be simpler to list what is not here.

In San Francisco, there is World Class shopping, eating, tourist spots. You should make reservations to go to Alcatraz because the ferry is often booked up.

Going South, there is Outlet Shopping in Gilroy, Monterey Aquarium, and many golf cities.

North is the Napa Wine Country. Home of OReilly Books.

The local organizers will provide tourism information and [customized maps](http://www.mapbuilder.net/index.php) and details of the many local activities.

# Because it is Time 

2003-5 were in DC, 2006 - 2007 was in Dallas, 2008-9 should be on the West Coast. It makes sense to move the convention around North America.
