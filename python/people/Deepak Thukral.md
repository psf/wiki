I\'m a computer science scholar love to play on python. I\'m currently coding a web based IDE for python(pyWebIDE), which can be use for smaller version of testing, learning python over web and live run for python tutorials.

Python WebIDE(Beta 1) [http://deepak.frih.net/cgi-bin/ide.py](http://deepak.frih.net/cgi-bin/ide.py) \[Since all executions are in open environment and no restriction in access modules, its humble request please dont try to make our host hurt.\]
