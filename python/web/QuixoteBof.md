The Quixote BoF session will be a rare chance for users and developers of Quixote to chat.

Possible discussions:

\* Plans for Quixote 1.0 (that is, [the roadmap](http://www.quixote.ca/qx/RoadMap))

Additional suggestions?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* +1 on the roadmap dicussion.

\* form2 \"roadmap\"

\* discussion of the sandbox idea? Can we set up a semi-permanent one? What code can we contribute? Small but complete examples of Quixote-driven apps, esp. showing different ways of connecting to data sources (rdbms, zodb, etc.)?

\* are there some HOWTO documents that we could outline, for addition to the Wiki?

\* discussing the Nevow syntax: is there interest? should we maintain our own, or wait for the Twisted version & integrate it?

\* thoughts on a \"Powered By Quixote\" button?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Observations: I18N for Quixote is important; how do you use gettext with it?

Unicode support in PTL?

PTL unicode all the way?

A few people would use the sandbox \-- not an overwhelming number, though.

The old stdlib request/response idea.

Transaction management for relational database

Look at Graham\'s context patch and consider adding it. (Name? model, context, facade, application, container, landscape?)

Advocacy ideas:

- improve recipes for using rewrite rules

- get the Quixote-powered button finalized (add \"by\")

- look at devIS\'s \"ezro\" ([http://ezro.devis.com/](http://ezro.devis.com/))
