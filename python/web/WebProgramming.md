## Web Programming in Python 

This topic guide attempts to cover every aspect of programming Web applications (both clients and servers) using Python.

### Server Programming 

Topics concerned with writing providing Web applications, doing server-side programming, providing a Web site or pages which use Python in some way:

- [WebFrameworks](WebFrameworks) - for developing server-side Web applications in Python

- [CgiScripts](../people/CgiScripts) - information on writing CGI scripts/programs in Python when the [WebFrameworks](WebFrameworks) seem like too much work or aren\'t available at your provider

- [WebServers](../people/WebServers) - server solutions written in (or using) Python

- [ContentManagementSystems](../archive/ContentManagementSystems) - solutions specially designed for organising and publishing content

- [WebServices](../people/WebServices) - tools for accessing and providing functionality via APIs over the Web

### Client Programming 

Topics concerned with accessing Web applications, sites or pages using Python:

- [WebBrowserProgramming](../archive/WebBrowserProgramming) - interfacing with existing browsers and browser technologies

- [WebClientProgramming](../archive/WebClientProgramming) - writing clients, typically at a lower level than a full Web browser

- [WebServices](../people/WebServices) - tools for accessing and providing functionality via APIs over the Web

This simplified start page replaces the previous \"comprehensive\" guide to Web programming. Unless adding a distinct category of Web programming, please add things like new frameworks to the appropriate page - not to this page.
