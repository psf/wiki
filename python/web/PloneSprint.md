Sunday - Tuesday a group of people will focus narrow mindedly on making Plone perform better. Plone has never had much time dedicated to optimization. At the point of this sprint the 2.0 series will have been released for 2 months. And There can be a 3 day sprint dedicated to this goal.

A side effect should be a document explaining the Dos and Donts in Zope2 development. Mainly if we find any enormous performance drags that are unexpected they should be documented.
