This will be a good opportunity to:

- Learn about Zope 3 development
- Contribute to Zope 3
- Meet other Zope 3 developers

The sprint will be held March 19-22.

As far as tasks go, I\'m pretty flexible.

If you plan to participate, please put your name below, and, if you won\'t be there all 4 days, indicate which days you plan to be there.

Participants:

- Jim Fulton
- Garrett Smith
- Brian Skahan

If you don\'t sign up, you can still come and participate. The sign up is to give us an idea who will be there.
