**Let\'s build a cool app for Zope 3!**

Last year, I participated in the Zope3 Development Sprint. While it was extremely valuable to me as a learning experience, I didn\'t feel I was contributing very much to the development of Zope3.

This year, I\'d like to collaborate on building a new and cool application *with* Zope3. I don\'t intend this to be a Zope3 tutorial (though I expect most participants will learn a lot).

# Participants 

- If you aren\'t planning to be available for all four days of the sprint, please note which days you will be around next to your name.

- [MichaelBernstein](MichaelBernstein)

- [AndyDustman](AndyDustman)

- (add your name here)

If you don\'t sign up, you can still come and participate. The sign up is to give us an idea who will be there.

# Goals 

Saturday, March 19

- Have fun!
- Meet and work with other Zope3 developers
- Build a functional application that will showcase Zope3
- Provide feedback on using Zope 3 to build apps

# Ideas for what app to build 

Write your suggestions here, and add your name to vote on the ones you like.

Ideally, the app should be one we can credibly complete in four days time, with a small but focused feature set and a reasonable amount of polish.

- A photo library/gallery ([photo/photoslides](http://svn.zope.org/photo/) already exists)

- An Amazon storefront

- Some kind of social-networking app (extending the \'buddy\' example?)
  - How about something along the lines of orkut meets Advogato meets del.icio.us meets Slashdot meets rawdog? There is a lot of overlapping functionality here; think of del.icio.us as the bizarro Slashdot, where everyone can post articles, duplicates are encouraged, and nobody can post comments. Major points:
    1.  Membership management
        a.  New members: How do members get added? Add themselves? Invited by other members? Invited/approved by administrators? b. Member relationships/ratings: Friend or foe? Guru or noob? Do you think I\'m sexy? I like cats.

    2.  Articles/links, and their keywords and comments.
        a.  rating system for articles, perhaps as simple as how many members linked to it recently (think del.icio.us/popular) b. keyword filters/modifiers

    3.  Diary/blog, or make this functionally the same as #2?

    4.  Syndication (like del.icio.us)

    5.  News reader/aggregator (like rawdog)

    6.  Event calendar (or perhaps incorporate space-time metadata into #2)

    7.  Make it scale.

- A discussion board (the Zope 3 programmers guide already [implements one](http://svn.zope.org/messageboard/))

- A weblog or other minimal CMS

- Port or reimplement an existing Zope2 app
  - Squishdot
  - (add your suggestion here)

- A Zope3 implementation of the [Java Pet Store](http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/jps131/docs/index.html) demo

- Build something using [MichelPelletier](./MichelPelletier.html)\'s Zemantic catalog

- A reStructuredText wiki that\'s really nice (good integration of the ReST structures with the wiki features)

- (add your suggestion here)

# Pre-requisites? 

Good question. I think some experience with Zope and Python would be a minimal reqirement, though we\'ll also have non-coding tasks like graphic design. Zope3 specific experience or having worked through the [Zope3 tutorial](http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/ProgrammerTutorial) would be ideal, but any familiarity with the [rest of the material](http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/Documentation) available would be welcome.
