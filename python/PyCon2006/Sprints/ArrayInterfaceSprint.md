# PyCon2006/Sprints/ArrayInterfaceSprint

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
The Array Interface is documented at [http://numeric.scipy.org/array_interface.html](http://numeric.scipy.org/array_interface.html){.http}

It would add the scientific computing community if this array interface were adopted by Python by getting a simple array object that carries the interface into the Python core. The goal of this sprint would be to write such an object.

Please post an interest email to [scipy-dev@scipy.net](mailto:scipy-dev@scipy.net){.mailto} if you are planning on coming to this event.
