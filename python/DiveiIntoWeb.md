## Introduction {#Introduction}

I\'m a PHP power programmer right now. Last month I learnt python, (as if it takes more than 2 days to learn it!). My main interest is in web development so PHP is so convinient for me, if we are talking about on-the-go integration with web server, but it\'s a pain in the ass if you talk about programming, I HATE its OO! Python just can rule the web if it were as friendly with the servers as php! I\'ve been through the internet, seen extremely boring tutorials on python web development without any concrete outcome, I\'m still left clueless about how to use it like php with apache, I know about the WSGI module which does not work on windows, but whatever I think is worth sharing in my further explorations, I\'ll put it up here and If you want to help me, I\'m no one to stop you!
