[ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com "ActiveState") provides end-to-end supply chain security for Python and other open source languages through our ActiveState Platform.

For Python developers, the ActiveState Platform provides:

- [Advanced Dependency Management](https://www.activestate.com/resources/product-demos/activestate-platform-what-to-do-when-you-encounter-a-solver-error/ "Advanced Dependency Management") - automated dependency resolution to ensure your environments won't be corrupted on upgrade, as well as simple solutions to dependency conflicts - no more dependency hell.

- Environment Reproducibility -- the ActiveState Platform acts as a central source of truth for your prebuilt Python runtime environments. Because the runtime is prebuilt, your dev and [DevOps](./DevOps.html) teams can eliminate "works on my machine" issues and wasted time troubleshooting bugs that turn out to be due to environment misconfigurations.

- [Vulnerability Remediation](https://www.activestate.com/resources/product-demos/activestate-platform-demo-vulnerabilities-remediation/ "Vulnerability Remediation") - dealing with vulnerabilities can take days of investigating, patching, testing and redeploying. Instead, the ActiveState Platform lets you identify and resolve vulnerable components in minutes, and then automatically rebuild a secure runtime environment.

For security professionals, the ActiveState Platform provides:

- A catalog of vetted Python packages.
- A secure, universal build service that builds Python packages and dependencies from source code, including linked C libraries.
- Signed packages (coming soon!) for Windows, Linux and MacOS featuring non-falsifiable provenance.

The ActiveState Platform integrates with your existing development workflow. It supplies prebuilt Python runtimes for your Dev and CI/CD environments, while providing the security your application needs.
