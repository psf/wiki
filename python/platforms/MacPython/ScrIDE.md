ScrIDE is a free OS X based IDE for the Python programming language by [GlennAndreas](GlennAndreas). If superceded [MacPython/PyOXIDE](./MacPython(2f)PyOXIDE.html). It includes a syntax coloring editor (with function popups navigation, quick open of included files, splitable panes, tooltips, completion) source level debugger, online embedded help, interactive shell windows (including \"inside\" debugging), and a whole lot of extensibility. It does not require any specific version of Python or third party add-ons (since it runs python processes \"externally\" it can be configured to even work with multiple versions at once).
