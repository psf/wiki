Find It! Keep It! - [http://www.ansemond.com](http://www.ansemond.com)\
\
Save webpages including some kinds of video to a local database with Find It! Keep It! Find the pages later by browsing your archive, or searching with tags and/or words.\
\
Find It! Keep It!\'s UI is written in [/PyObjc](./MacPython(2f)MacSoftwareUsingPython(2f)PyObjc.html) but it also uses custom C extensions. Python\'s interactive command line made understanding Cocoa easier and sped up prototyping. Exceptions improved reliability, but segfaults in Cocoa called from Python were very hard to debug. Being able to constrain functions types and faster execution would be have been handy.
