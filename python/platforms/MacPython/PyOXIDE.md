PyOXIDE is an open-source OS X based IDE for the Python programming language by [GlennAndreas](GlennAndreas). Note that this product has been \"end of lifed\" and replaced with [../ScrIDE](./MacPython(2f)ScrIDE.html) (and is only really useful if you\'re painfully curious or running 10.2 or 10.3 and earlier versions of Python)
