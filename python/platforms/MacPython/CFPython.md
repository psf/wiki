# CFPython 

Source code to the CFPython library included with the [/userdefaults](./MacPython(2f)CFPython(2f)userdefaults.html) module.

CFPython is a C library intended to make programming with the Python C API and [CoreFoundation](./CoreFoundation.html) easier. CFPython makes copies of Python objects as their mutable [CoreFoundation](./CoreFoundation.html) counterparts, and is able to perform the same translations in reverse.
