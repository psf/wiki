[DrawBot](http://drawbot.com) is a simple application for MacOSX that allows you to write simple Python scripts that generate two-dimensional graphics. The builtin graphics primitives are currently pretty braindead, it currently only supports rectangles, ovals and (bezier) paths and polygons. A future version will also support text and images.

Currently developed by [JustVanRossum](JustVanRossum).

[BobIppolito](BobIppolito) and [BrendanHall](./BrendanHall.html) are hacking on a DrawBot based project that includes dynamic GUI generation (using [GNUStep Renaissance](http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/)) and more, it will probably end up being a fork as the plans are to become a tool for designing, not so much for teaching. You can download the prototype, which includes a self-contained application and the source from the links section. Here\'s a screenshot:\
