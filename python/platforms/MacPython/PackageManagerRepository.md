# What Is PackageManager? 

Since Python 2.3, [MacPython](MacPython) has included the [/PackageManager](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManager.html) application. Though [/PackageManager](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManager.html) is still in its early stages, it\'s a huge time saver for acquiring Python modules and extensions that are tested (or modified) to work with OS X. The majority of modules in a [/PackageManagerRepository](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManagerRepository.html) can be installed precompiled with a single click.

Note that [/PackageManager](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManager.html) is **only** for [MacPython](MacPython) 2.3. The package manager page is located at [http://www.python.org/packman/](http://www.python.org/packman/).

# How Do I Use PackageManager? 

With an normal installation of [MacPython](MacPython) 2.3, [/PackageManager](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManager.html) is located at [/ApplicationsMacPython](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)ApplicationsMacPython.html)-2.3/PackageManager.app. By default, it will point to the official [PackageManagerRepository](./PackageManagerRepository.html), maintained by [JackJansen](JackJansen). You may choose an alternate [/PackageManagerRepository](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManagerRepository.html) by choosing Open URL from the File menu.

# Where Are The Alternate Package Manager Repositories? 

So far, there is only one known alternate [/PackageManagerRepository](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManagerRepository.html) for OS X (or any platform, for that matter). This \"Official Unofficial\" [/PackageManagerRepository](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManagerRepository.html) is maintained by [BobIppolito](BobIppolito), and you can find instructions and an up to date package list at [http://undefined.org/python/pimp/](http://undefined.org/python/pimp/). It includes many more modules than the official [/PackageManagerRepository](./MacPython(2f)PackageManagerRepository(2f)PackageManagerRepository.html) inluding some compiled in exotic ways (such as Numeric against Apple\'s vecLib, or PIL with the libtiff patch).
