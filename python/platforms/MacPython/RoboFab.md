# /RoboFab 

LtrWiki:RoboFab is a Python package written by LtrWiki:TalLeming, [/ErikVanBlokland](./MacPython(2f)RoboFab(2f)ErikVanBlokland.html) and [JustVanRossum](JustVanRossum). It started its life as an attempt for a better Python scripting layer for LtrWiki:FontLab, but it has grown to a platform and application independent library of font and glyph objects and tools.

## status

LtrWiki:RoboFab is currently at version 1.1, public release.
