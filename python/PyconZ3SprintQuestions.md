Paul Winkler here, couple things i wanted to touch on that seemed too cumbersome to email to the whole sprint group\...

Workstations: Is this BYO?

- Jim Answers: Yes

If so, any particular Python version I should install? 2.2.2?

- Jim Answers: Yes

  See [http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/SettingUpAZope3Sandbox](http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/SettingUpAZope3Sandbox){.http}

Anything else required? cvs of course\... (n. yergler):

- You should be able to do a writable checkout of the Zope 3 sources.

Additionally, is there any problem with different OS\'s? My primary notebook is an iBook (and I have cvs, ssh, python 2.3a2, z3.py running on it), but I can bring something else if necessary\...

- That should be OK. Try to set up and run Zope ahead of time.

Experience: I hope I\'m not totally over my head here,

- Jim says: nah

I suspect I\'m the biggest noob of the bunch. I\'ve never done XP before. I\'ve been a pythonista since about \'99 and working with Zope 2 almost as long; currently I\'m a full-time Zope / python developer. But I haven\'t done squat with Z3 and i have limited time to play with it before Monday. I did read [http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/pairing.htm](http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/pairing.htm){.http} and feel a bit better ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":)"){height="16" width="16"}

Pair programming & editor wars: i can work OK in vim or emacs, but what if my partner won\'t work without his Bloatware IDE [SuperDeluxe](./SuperDeluxe.html){.nonexistent}? ![;-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile4.png ";-)"){height="16" width="16"}
