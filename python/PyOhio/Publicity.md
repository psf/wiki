Some of the things that we would like to do include:

- Get the word out to local bloggers to have them blog about the conference and generate hype.
- Once talks are confirmed, do interviews with some of the speakers to get people curious about what\'s going on.
- Do spotlights on some of the things we\'re doing at the conference. Feature things like:
  - What are sprints?
  - What are lightning talks?
  - What are open spaces?
