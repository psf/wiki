# PyOhio/Talks

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
PyOhio 2008 drew a variety of excellent speakers from around Ohio and beyond. For 2009, we are inviting talks in a variety of formats, including hands-on tutorials.

We expect an even better variety of speakers in 2009 - possibly including you! See our 2009 [Call for Proposals](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyOhio/CallForProposals){.http .reference .external}, due May 15.

For 2009, we are also planning a Beginners\' Track. If you\'re new to Python, or new to programming in general, we\'ll have events designed to get you up and running in Python quickly!

Watch this space as our planning process continues. We plan to announce accepted talks June 1.
