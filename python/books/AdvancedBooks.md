[Python Coding -- One Year Later: A Treasure Trove of Practical and Simple Examples](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RJ2W1TY)

Cathy Young

ISBN: 9798707217357 M & C Publishing 356 Pages (December 2020)

Book Overview:

Learn the simple basics of debugging a Python script so your code runs as expected. Chapter 3 presents \"Python Basics\" because a big part of debugging is knowing the correct syntax for a particular object and task. Dozens of diagrams explain concepts such as indexing, slicing, scope, or recursive functions. The syntax relevant to each type of object is also shown. To add to a \"list,\" you could use \'append,\' \'join\' or \'extend\' methods. While adding a new key:value pair to a dictionary is straightforward, adding to an existing dictionary requires you to know the \"type\" of object in the key:value pair to determine which methods to use to add, update, or delete objects.

Copy and paste over 50 real-world self-contained examples into your IDE and run the code snippets. Between the detailed Table of Contents and extensive Index, you can quickly find answers. The Index includes common phrases for those times when you don\'t know the technical term. For example, to find a string in Python, you could use the \"in\" comparison operator. Whether you look for \"find\" or \"search,\" the Index refers you to the \"in\" comparison operator. The examples are varied so you can work with different types of data, such as: XML, HTML, matplotlib (plots/charts/graphs), OS (files/directories), \*.txt, \*.csv, user input, or dates.

Deep learning and data science using a Python and Keras library - The complete guide from a beginner to professional

The world has been obsessed with the terms \"machine learning\" and \"deep learning\" recently. We use these technologies every day, with or without our knowledge. Ranging from Google suggestions to translations, ads, movie recommendations, friend suggestions, sales and customer experiences. There are tons of other applications too so there's no wonder that deep learning and machine learning specialists, along with data science practitioners, are the most sought-after talent in the current technology world. But the problem is that, when you think about learning these technologies, there is a common misconception that it's a prerequisite to study lots of maths, statistics, and complex algorithms. It's almost like someone making you believe that you must learn the working of an internal combustion engine before you learn how to drive a car

This course is organized and an overview of the list of topics included. Overall, this is a basic to an advanced crash course in deep learning neural networks and convolutional neural networks using Keras and Python.

Gain valuable insights from your data by streamlining unstructured data pipelines with Python, Spark, and MongoDB

This course is a comprehensive, practical guide to using MongoDB and Spark in Python, learning how to store and make sense of huge data sets, and performing basic machine learning tasks to make predictions.

MongoDB is one of the most powerful non-relational database systems available offering robust scalability and expressive operations that, when combined with Python data analysis libraries and distributed computing, represent a valuable set of tools for the modern data scientist. NoSQL databases require a new way of thinking about data and scalable queries. Once Mongo queries have been mastered, it is necessary to understand how we can leverage this API in Python\'s rich analysis and visualization ecosystem. This course will cover how to use MongoDB, particularly if you are used to SQL databases, with a focus on scalability to large datasets. pyMongo is introduced as the means to interact with a MongoDB database from within Python code and the data structures used to do so are explored. MongoDB uniquely allows for complex operations and aggregations to be run within the query itself and we will cover how to use these operators. While MongoDB itself is built for easy scalability across many nodes as datasets grow, Python is not. Therefore, we cover how we can use Spark with MongoDB to handle more complex machine learning techniques for extremely large datasets. This learning will be applied to several examples of real-world datasets and analyses that can form the basis of your own pipelines, allowing you to quickly get up-and-running with a powerful data science toolkit.

[Advanced Predictive Techniques with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (Video)](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/advanced-predictive-techniques-scikit-learn-and-tensorflow-video)

Alvaro Fuentes

ISBN 13: 9781788295321 Packt Course Length: 3 hours 44 minutes (November 2017)

Video Overview:

Improve the performance predictive models, build more complex models and use techniques to improve quality of your predictive models.

Ensemble methods offer a powerful way to improve prediction accuracy by combining in a clever way predictions from many individual predictors. In this course, you will learn how to use ensemble methods to improve accuracy in classification and regression problems.

When using Predictive Analytics to solve actual problems, besides models and algorithms there are many other practical considerations that must be considered like which features should you use, how many features are enough, should you create new features, how to combine features to give the same underlying information, which hyper-parameters should you use? You explore topics that will help you answer such questions.

Artificial Neural Networks are models loosely based on how neural networks work in a living being. These models have a long history in the Artificial Intelligence community with ups and downs in popularity. Nowadays, because of the increase in computational power, improved methods, and software enhancements, they are popular again and are the basis for advanced approaches such as Deep Learning. This course introduces the use of Deep Learning models for Predictive Analytics using the powerful [TensorFlow](./TensorFlow.html) library.

Sebastiaan Mathôt

ISBN 13: 9781788292450 Packt Publishing Course Length: 2 hours and 34 minutes (July 2017)

Video Overview:

In this video course, you will learn what functional programming is, and how it differs from other programming styles, such as procedural and object-oriented programming. You will also learn why and when functional programming is useful, and why and when it makes programs unnecessarily complex. Explore lambda expressions, which are short one-line functions, and are the purest form of functional programming that Python offers. Next, learn about higher-order functions: functions that accept other functions as argument, or return other functions as return values. In Python, higher-order functions are elegantly supported through decorators. You will also encounter important concepts from functional programming, such as monads, currying, statelessness, side-effects, memoization, and referential transparency; these concepts may initially seem odd to Python programmers, but you will see how they are elegantly supported by the language. In fact, many Python programmers already make use of concepts from functional programming without being aware of doing so.

All the videos in this course contain hands-on examples of the introduced concepts.

What you will learn:

- Recognize the value of Functional Programming
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming
- Higher-order functions and Lambda expressions (nameless functions)
- Error handling in Functional Programming
- Understand common functional design patterns, and how these apply to Python
