[Python from Scratch](https://pythonfromscratch.com)

By Nilo Ney Coutinho Menezes

- Logikraft/Novatec
- ISBN: 978-85-7522-949-1 (Paperback), 978-85-7522-950-7 (Hardcover), 978-85-7522-951-4 (E-book)
- Publication May/June, 2025

**Book Overview**

This book is designed specifically with programming beginners in mind. Basic programming concepts --- such as expressions, variables, loops, decisions, lists, dictionaries, sets, functions, files, classes, objects, SQLite 3 databases, regular expressions and graphical interfaces with Tkinter --- are clearly presented one by one with examples and exercises to illustrate. The book aims to explore computer programming as an everyday tool. It can be read during an introduction to computer programming course or used as a study guide for self-learners. Only basic computer knowledge, such as typing texts, opening and saving files, is needed to start the course. All software used in the book can be downloaded for free and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Although Python (version +3.13) is a very powerful language full of modern programming features, this book focuses primarily on programming logic and teaching how to program. Some language features were not used in order to favor programming logic exercises and offer the reader broader preparation for other languages. Powerful language features such as generators, sets, lambda functions and comprehensions are presented, and the reader will find various notes and explanations of Python-specific features in addition to programming logic.

**Who this book is written for:**

Students who want to learn programming on their own, the book was written so you can gradually learn to program. The first chapters explain the basic programming concepts in a logical order, with practical exercises. All you need to know is how to use a computer and a browser (Firefox, Edge, Safari, or Google Chrome). The book starts by showing how to download and install Python on Windows, but it also covers Linux (Ubuntu) and macOS. Special attention was given to conditional structures (if), loops (while), and functions (including recursion). The book also covers string manipulation (text processing), so you learn to work with variables containing text and prepare to write more complete programs. At the end, we cover files, creating simple web pages, a light introduction to object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and graphical interfaces.

Released 2025

1819 Pages

**Book Overview**

The aim of this book is to take the reader from the basic knowledge of computing essentials for programming in Python to a level of proficiency that will enable you to write a full-fledged desktop application with a graphical user interface.

In a single book, the reader will get essentially the material of three books in a consistent structure: an introduction to the basic concepts and language building blocks, the application of the commonly used standard library modules, and the development of graphical user interfaces.

The book starts from scratch, and the subsequent chapters build on each other. Therefore, it can be used as a textbook for beginners who want to learn computer programming and Python. Hence, it can be useful for high school, university, and course students or hobby programmers.

This book is particularly recommended for those who wish to attend a Python course but for some reason (caring for a small child, limited mobility, distance, time constraints, etc.) cannot. The book can help in this situation because its content covers the knowledge that is provided in courses from beginner to advanced level, but it can be studied at the reader\'s own pace.

As the presented body of knowledge is gradually deepening and leads to more and more subtle details of the language, this book is also recommended for teachers, engineers, software developers, data analysts, and data scientists.

Create stunning interactive dashboard applications in Python with the Dash visualization and data analysis tool. Build interfaces that make sense of your data, and make it pretty.

A swift and practical introduction to building interactive data visualization apps in Python, known as dashboards. You've seen dashboards before; think election result visualizations you can update in real time, or population maps you can filter by demographic. With the Python Dash library you'll create analytic dashboards that present data in effective, usable, elegant ways in just a few lines of code.

The book is fast-paced and caters to those entirely new to dashboards. It will talk you through the necessary software, then get straight into building the dashboards themselves. You'll learn the basic format of a Dash app by building a Twitter analysis dashboard that maps the number of likes certain accounts gained over time. You'll build up skills through three more sophisticated projects. The first is a global analysis app that compares country data in three areas: the percentage of a population using the internet, percentage of parliament seats held by women, and CO2 emissions. You'll then build an investment portfolio dashboard, and an app that allows you to visualize and explore machine learning algorithms.

In this book you will:

- Create and run your first Dash apps
- Use the pandas library to manipulate and analyze social media data
- Use Git to download and build on existing apps written by the pros
- Visualize machine learning models in your apps
- Create and manipulate statistical and scientific charts and maps using Plotly

Dash combines several technologies to get you building dashboards quickly and efficiently. This book will do the same.

[Actionable Python 3.8](https://www.amazon.com/Python-3-8-Nat-Dunn/dp/1951959027)

Nat Dunn, Webucator

ISBN-13: 978-1951959029 536 Pages (March 15, 2020)

**Book Overview:**

Learning to program is hard. Don't let anyone tell you different. If you bought or are considering buying this book because someone told you that you should learn Python, then maybe you should reconsider. The big question to ask yourself is *"Do you want to learn Python?"* Certainly, this book will help you answer that question, but be prepared to struggle, and to make mistakes, and to get frustrated, and to bang your head against the keyboard. This is Pandora's box, baby, but...

If you get excited by solving hard problems... if you're into Sudoku, or crosswords, or jigsaw puzzles, or if you'll spend hours trying to figure out how to separate two metal looping thingamajigs that you found on someone's shelf..., or you like tinkering with engines, or figuring out the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies... in other words, if you like a challenge, then you might love Python programming.It's not easy, but it's easy enough to get started. Pick up a book (good start!), and start going through it. Be patient with yourself. Pretend you're the teacher as well as the student. When the student fails, the good teacher doesn't insult or chastise. The good teacher encourages. The good teacher knows that failure is a part of learning, and that overcoming failure is exciting and leads to more learning. **So, be a good teacher and treat yourself well.**

**But be a good student too.** When reading this book, you should be sitting at your computer. When you first begin, plan to spend at least two uninterrupted hours. You should do your best to get through the first two lessons in the first sitting. That will get you through the foundational learning. From there on out, you'll be hopping back and forth between the book and viewing, editing, and writing code. Go through the book slowly and methodically. Read every demo carefully. Work through every exercise. You cannot learn to code through reading alone. You must practice.

This book assume no prior knowledge of Python, but it introduces some pretty advanced topics, such as working with databases, scraping the web, and object-oriented Python.

[The Python Coding Book: Understanding what programming really is](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/)

Stephen Gruppetta

Freely available online book

**Book Overview:**

**The key to mastering programming is to truly understand why we do things** in the way we do them. Learning the methods is not enough.

ISBN: 978-1514376980

246 pages, 2015

Getting started with programming can be an intimidating challenge. Most books and tutorials assume lots of previous knowledge, skip over jargon and new concepts, and use examples that only make sense if you already understand programming.

This book is different. It gives you an introduction to programming in Python from the ground up, starting with tips on installation and setting up your programming environment, and moving through the core parts of the Python language in a logical order. Dr. Jones has drawn on his many years experience teaching programming to produce a book that will guide you through the language step by step in simple terms.

The book doesn\'t assume any previous knowledge, and introduces fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops and functions using simple terms and easy-to-follow examples that you can run and modify.

The book takes a unique approach to practical exercises. Rather than simply presenting you with the solutions, it shows you how large, complex programs are gradually built up from simple building blocks, explaining the role of every line. You can download the examples and exercise solutions - edit, modify and run them yourself.

Nearly every car, phone, or camera has a GPS sensor, and aerial photos, satellite imagery, and data representing political boundaries, roads, rivers, and streams are available for free download from many websites. Geoprocessing is the science of reading, analyzing, and presenting geospatial data programmatically. The Python language, along with dozens of open source libraries and tools, makes it possible to take on professional geoprocessing tasks without investing in expensive proprietary packages like ArcGIS and [MapInfo](./MapInfo.html).

Geoprocessing with Python teaches you how to use the Python programming language along with free and open source tools to read, write, and process geospatial data. You\'ll learn how to access available data sets to make maps or perform your own analyses using free and open source tools like the GDAL, Shapely, and Fiona Python modules. You\'ll master core practices like handling multiple vector file formats, editing and manipulating geometries, applying spatial and attribute filters, working with projections, and performing basic analyses on vector data. You\'ll also learn how to create geospatial data, rather than just consuming it. The book also covers how to manipulate and analyze raster data, such as aerial photographs, satellite images, and digital elevation models.

[Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language (Second Edition)](http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html) by Mark Summerfield

- ISBN10: 0321680561
- Addison-Wesley Professional
- 648 pages (November 2009)

This book teaches you how to write programs using Python 3 in good Python 3 style.

The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, including scientists and engineers, who need to do some programming in support of their work. It will also prove ideal for those Python 2 programmers who need to migrate (or prepare to migrate) to Python 3. The book is also suitable for students---the only prerequisite is some basic knowledge of programming in any language, for example, Basic or Java, or of course Python itself.

The book teaches solid procedural style programming, then builds on that to teach solid object-oriented programming, and then goes on to more advanced topics such as descriptors and class decorators. But even newcomers to Python 3 should be able to write useful (although small and basic) programs after reading chapter 1, and then go on to create larger and more sophisticated programs as they work through the chapters.

The book\'s [web site](http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html) lists the table of contents and has links to extracts. It also has all the examples and exercise solutions available for download.

**Core Python Programming**

- Wesley J. Chun

ISBN: 0132269937 (2nd ed.); 0130260363 (1st ed.)

Prentice Hall PTR / Pearson Education

\~1120 pages (Sep 2006); 810 pages (Jan 2001)

The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don\'t really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more **effective** Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or \"quick dives\" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference \-- it is \*not\* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the *Python Essential Reference* or *Python in a Nutshell*.

The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material. As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today.

From an anonymous reviewer: \"Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure.\"

**[Programming with Python](https://thomasweise.github.io/programmingWithPython/programmingWithPython.pdf)** by Thomas Weise

The goal of this book is to teach practical programming with the Python language to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students alike (in English language). Hopefully, readers without prior knowledge can follow the text. Therefore, all concepts are introduced using examples and discussed comprehensively. All examples are available online in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomasWeise/programmingWithPythonCode) associated with this book, so that readers can play with them easily. Actually, the goal of the book is not just to teach programming, but to teach programming as a part of the software development process. This means that from the very beginning, we will attempt to push the reader towards writing clean code with comments and documentation as well as to use various tools for finding potential issues. While this book is work in progress, we hope that it will eventually teach all the elements of Python software creation. We hope that it can enable readers without prior programming experience to develop beautiful and maintainable software.

All the material available alongside with the book, including slides in German language, can be found on the [book website](https://thomasweise.github.io/programmingWithPython). The book is actively developed in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thomasWeise/programmingWithPython) and thus not only free but also open source itself. If you find any issue, error, typo, have a suggestion, or want to drop a review \-- feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/thomasWeise/programmingWithPython/issues).

## Python 2 

**Practical Programming (in Python)** [\"Practical Programming (in Python)\"](https://launchpad.net/practical-programming) is meant as a first programming course and is tightly aligned with the [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz) introductory programming course called [Practical Programming](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/student/papers.php?name=COMP150). The textbook is organized into 24 \"lectures\" that cover all the basics of programming (sequence, selection, iteration, functions etc), plus all the major data structures supplied by Python.

This textbook is a modified version of [\"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition\"](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/), by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers.

**How Would Pareto Learn Python!**

[Rahul Verma](http://www.testingperspective.com/?page_id=1889)

Python is a very powerful high level object oriented language and has easy bindings with C,C++,Java etc. It can very well be the first and the only language needed by a software tester for routine test automation tasks as well as for building robust general purpose test automation frameworks.

This online book is written keeping beginners in Python in mind. It bridges the gap between very basic tutorials and comprehensive books.

The book is provided for free by [Talent Reboot Trainings and Asessments](http://www.talentreboot.com) and hosts the online version of the book as a part of its official website.
