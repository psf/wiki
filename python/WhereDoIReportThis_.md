## A bug with Python itself {#A_bug_with_Python_itself}

Raise an issue on the [Python Issue Tracker](https://bugs.python.org/){.https}

NB the Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for help with debugging your code. Only post there if you have good reason to believe that your code is correct but that Python itself is faulty. Check the [Python FAQ](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/){.https} first in case your issue is covered there.

## A Python trademark question {#A_Python_trademark_question}

If you wish to use Python as a trademark or have a question about someone who has, the [PSF Trademark Usage page](https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/){.https} has the details.

You can contact the [PSF Trademarks Committtee](mailto:psf-trademarks@python.org){.mailto} about specific issues not addressed by that page.

## An issue with PyPI {#An_issue_with_PyPI}

If you notice a bug with PyPI raise it on [their issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/){.https}. You will need to have (or create) a Bitbucket account to create issues. If this is a problem for you, please report the issue to [webmaster@python.org](mailto:webmaster@python.org){.mailto} who will attempt to post the issue for you.

Send a message to the [Python Security Response Team](mailto:security@python.org){.mailto}.

## A problem with one of the python.org mailing lists {#A_problem_with_one_of_the_python.org_mailing_lists}

## An issue with the Python infrastructure {#An_issue_with_the_Python_infrastructure}

The infrastructure is managed by the [Infrastructure team](http://psf-salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview/){.http}. They can be contacted via [infrastructure-staff@python.org](mailto:infrastructure-staff@python.org){.mailto}.
