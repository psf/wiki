# Krys Wilken

I am a computer programmer/analyst and network and system administrator, working for the government of Canada where I manage a small team of developers and techs. I have a B.Sc with Honours in Computer Science from the University of Ottawa. I have been programming and building systems for about 19 years now.

And I love Python! :)

Currently, I have a [blog](http://krys.ca){.http .reference .external} and a small Open Source [project](http://dev.krys.ca/turbolucene){.http .reference .external}. I am also trying to get Python accepted at work as a valid development tool.
