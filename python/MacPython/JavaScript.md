John J. Lee has an (unmaintained) Python-Javascript bridge:

OS X 10.4 now includes Javascript and Cocoa bridges which can be used in Widgets and [/WebKit](./MacPython(2f)JavaScript(2f)WebKit.html){.nonexistent} objects.

But PyObjC may be superior.

From The ADC article \"Using PyObjC for Developing Cocoa Applications with Python\" ( [http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html){.http})

\*\*Many Bridges to Your Destination\*\* PyObjC is just one of many Cocoa bridges. Apple has offered its Java bridge since Mac OS X 10.0, and Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 rolled out a [/JavaScript](./MacPython(2f)JavaScript(2f)JavaScript.html){.nonexistent} bridge which allows Dashboard Widgets to communicate with Objective-C objects. Third-party developers have also created bridges for C#, Lisp, Perl, Ruby and Smalltalk to name a few. And, of course, Python.
