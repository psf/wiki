VPython is a very easy to use, \"pythonic\" way to create interactive 3D applications. It was developed primarily for use in physics simulations, but I have used it to demonstrate various geometric shapes and properties to my kids, and to demonstrate the bookshelf I wanted to build for my wife. \--[DetheElza](DetheElza)
