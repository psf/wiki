# Python and Databases {#Python_and_Databases}

We intend to show that Python is an ideal language to choose for database interaction. In particular, the Python DBI offers a consistent look and feel when it comes to using just about any database.

[Brainstorming](./AdvocacyWritingTasks(2f)PythonAndDatabases(2f)BrainStorm.html){.nonexistent} - This is where we can record ideas, try formats, and debate the topics to be covered. Have an idea to share? This is where you want to start.

[Whitepaper](./AdvocacyWritingTasks(2f)PythonAndDatabases(2f)WhitePaperPage.html){.nonexistent} - A short, sweet, and highly impressive argument that Python is the ideal language to use when connecting to any database.

[Pamphlet](./AdvocacyWritingTasks(2f)PythonAndDatabases(2f)PamphletPage.html){.nonexistent} - This is where we store copy and images for the various pamphlets we may (or may not) create.
