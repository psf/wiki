# AbqPython is the local Python user\'s group in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

This group is mainly organized as a MeetUp group: [http://www.meetup.com/AbqPython/](http://www.meetup.com/AbqPython/). We generally meet on the first Tuesday of the month. See the Meetup page for upcoming events and meeting details (the location sometimes changes).

We also have a listserv. To sign up, visit [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/abqpy](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/abqpy).

Members are encouraged to get themselves into [the editor\'s group of this Wiki](FrontPage#use) and to create their own pages to serve as a home for their Python (and other) notes and to contribute to this page and pages under it.
