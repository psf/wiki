    16:06:59 on < svaksha> i have them in a text file which i pasted
    16:07:29 on < lut4rp> should work without <pre> as well.
    16:07:32 on < lut4rp> weird.

    16:14:32 on <@ramkrsna> anandbpillai, lawgon isnt there, he left a message before that he would be logging the discussion
    16:14:43 on < Khmar> 'is' is symmetric in this context.

    16:22:42 on <@Khmar> Fair enough
    16:22:42 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, thanks for the detailed post of what needs to be discussed

    16:23:31 on <@Khmar> Okay. Thank you all for coming.
    16:23:36 on <@anandbpillai> I suggest we discuss one after the other, i.e spent a few minutes on the proposal (theme  of the conf), then we can go to topics like sponsorship, finance etc
    16:23:36 on <@Khmar> The first thing is the date.
    16:23:42 on  * mib_nq32pc this is baiju , no power here :(
    16:24:00 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    16:24:07 on <@Khmar> I'm going as per the order in the mail I sent out.
    16:24:08 on < techno_freak> ## Theme of the Conference ##
    16:24:10 on <@anandbpillai> Can we set a sub-topic as date on the channel
    16:24:12 on < mib_nq32pc> 3,4,5 september
    16:24:12 on <@Khmar> so that we can stay on the same page.
    16:24:15 on <@anandbpillai> ok, theme
    16:24:32 on -!- mib_nq32pc is now known as baijum3
    16:24:41 on <@Khmar> 3,4,5 September.
    16:24:47 on <@Khmar> No arguments there.

    16:25:05 on < rmathews> date sounds good
    16:25:14 on <@Khmar> I don't seriously think there are any other Python conferences at that time.
    16:25:16 on -!- baijum2 is now known as baijum
    16:25:21 on <@Khmar> Do we need to check? Atleast some mails?
    16:25:22 on <@anandbpillai> well, september is a good month, date is fine. Does it clash with other confs ?
    16:25:30 on < techno_freak> i dont think so
    16:25:37 on < mj0vy> Where in Bangalore?
    16:25:40 on <@Khmar> lawgon might know. He maintains the calendar
    16:25:43 on < G0SUB> 2010, right?
    16:25:44 on <@Khmar> mj0vy: We'll come that.
    16:25:46 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, I'm sure there are no community run python conferences
    16:26:00 on <@Khmar> mj0vy: We're discussing date.
    16:26:01 on <@ramkrsna> by the indian python community afaik
    16:26:03 on < rmathews> G0SUB: 2009
    16:26:05 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    16:26:09 on < techno_freak> not any big FOSS conference as well
    16:26:13 on <@Khmar> Any other conferences in general?
    16:26:15 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    16:26:16 on <@Khmar> That's good.
    16:26:21 on < G0SUB> rmathews: hmm, isn't that too early?
    16:26:23 on <@Khmar> So, we'll settle with 3,4,5 Sep
    16:26:30 on < jace> +1
    16:26:33 on < techno_freak> +1
    16:26:36 on < rmathews> G0SUB: now will be a good time to speak up
    16:26:42 on < baijum> +1
    16:26:46 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, before we dive into the date. there are a few thinks all the participants in this room need to know
    16:26:46 on < G0SUB> rmathews: are we well prepped for a conf of this scale?
    16:26:47 on <@Khmar> G0SUB: You think it will be?
    16:26:51 on <@ramkrsna> +1 for the day
    16:26:55 on <@anandbpillai> note that 3,4,5 is thu,fri,sat
    16:27:00 on <@anandbpillai> why not 4,5,6 then ?
    16:27:06 on <@anandbpillai> so sunday is involved
    16:27:09 on <@Khmar> One day to recover?
    16:27:11 on < rmathews> ohh, right 4, 5, 6 then is better
    16:27:22 on < G0SUB> Khmar: think about the scale ...
    16:27:26 on < techno_freak> first half of september is good
    16:27:27 on <@anandbpillai> i mean was there anything special about 3,4,5 by the original proposer ? please clarify
    16:27:27 on < rmathews> two days leave?
    16:27:34 on < jace> people need sunday off to recover. i prefer 3,4,5.
    16:27:36 on < G0SUB> shouldn't we organise some smaller events first?
    16:27:45 on < munichlinux> anandbpillai, +1 for the date
    16:27:49 on <@ramkrsna> +1, for 3,4, 5
    16:27:50 on <@Khmar> G0SUB: This needn't be larger than we can handle.
    16:27:55 on <@Khmar> +1 for 3,4,5
    16:27:56 on < techno_freak> +1 for 3,4,5
    16:27:57 on < jace> G0SUB: it can be done if there's good management in place.
    16:28:06 on < jace> and there's plenty of time for that
    16:28:10 on < falcon74> +1 for 3,4,5
    16:28:10 on < abhinav> +1 for 3,4,5
    16:28:15 on < G0SUB> jace: That's a bit iffy...
    16:28:18 on <@anandbpillai> well, smaller events do make sense, i mean we need to discuss that
    16:28:22 on <@Khmar> G0SUB: We'll decide to scale it down or move it if we can't show any promise in a short while.
    16:28:27 on < baijum> I suggest September 4,5,6 originally...
    16:28:28 on <@Khmar> anandbpillai: We will.
    16:28:29 on <@anandbpillai> something like a BoF for Py con india this barcamp makes sense
    16:28:31 on < G0SUB> Khmar: makes sense
    16:28:37 on < rmathews> I guess, that does it.  So 4, 5, 6 is out by vote.
    16:28:39 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: yeah
    16:28:46 on <@anandbpillai> ok, 3,4,5 sounds good
    16:28:46 on <@Khmar> 3,4,5 then.
    16:28:49 on <@Khmar> That's settled.
    16:28:54 on < techno_freak> ok more 3,4,5 and less 4,5,6
    16:29:03 on <@Khmar> Anyone who doesn't like it can take a hike. :P
    16:29:03 on < techno_freak> so it's September 3rd, 4th and 5th
    16:29:21 on < rmathews> Khmar: goes without saying. :)
    16:29:22 on < G0SUB> going straight for a PyCon without having any other smaller meets seems to be a very hasty attempt to me...
    16:29:24 on <@anandbpillai> please, moderator, don't overlord
    16:29:29 on <@anandbpillai> thanks :)
    16:29:33 on <@Khmar> anandbpillai: Kidding. :)
    16:29:36 on < G0SUB> we don't even have any idea about the audience
    16:29:56 on < techno_freak> i rend to agree with G0SUB in that point
    16:29:59 on < techno_freak> tend*
    16:29:59 on < rmathews> G0SUB: you have a very valid point
    16:30:06 on < jace> G0SUB: might as well aim for a significant event. this meeting and the next couple will decide if it can be done.
    16:30:07 on < rmathews> Khmar: may we pause to discuss that?
    16:30:28 on <@Khmar> I think that's an important point and I've got a bullet for that.
    16:30:28 on <@anandbpillai> Folks, actually date should be one of the last items, thinking about it logically
    16:30:30 on < jace> G0SUB: from my experience, organising a large event is less of a problem than preventing too many cooks from entering the kitchen
    16:30:32 on < abhinav> G0SUB: smaller meet like?
    16:30:35 on < rmathews> anandbpillai: yes
    16:30:36 on <@anandbpillai> i mean let us discuss the meat, core first
    16:30:44 on < G0SUB> abhinav: a barcamp style one?
    16:30:46 on < techno_freak> yes, until we get all these fixed, date can't be fixed
    16:30:47 on < rmathews> anandbpillai: yes!
    16:30:48 on < G0SUB> jace: I agree
    16:30:53 on < rmathews> techno_freak: yes!!!
    16:30:58 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, the point being how big a event do you think  PyCon India is going to be ?
    16:31:02 on < jace> G0SUB: BCB4 had 650+ participants. it only took 5-6 people and a couple of months to organise.
    16:31:06 on < falcon74> very true, date should come last... first let's see what all we need to get there... a "tentative" date should be fine. better not "freeze" it.
    16:31:07 on <@anandbpillai> i mean fix the girl, before you fix the wedding date man
    16:31:12 on < techno_freak> ## What's about the PyCon India ##
    16:31:20 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: I am judging the scale by the name. International people will be looking
    16:31:27 on < jace> PyCon will be different because it will have more order and international participants, but it can be done in the ~6 months we have
    16:31:30 on < baijum> I guess, for PyCon India, we can expect around 600
    16:31:56 on <@Khmar> Good point. We'll keep the date out of the way for now.
    16:32:02 on <@Khmar> 600 people.
    16:32:04 on < abhinav> 600 sound a bit more
    16:32:05 on < G0SUB> can't we have some FOSSMeets before we try a FOSS.in ?
    16:32:08 on <@ramkrsna> baijum, I would think  around 400, must be a good crowd
    16:32:10 on <@anandbpillai> right, so as per prev discussion sep 3,4,5 is the tentative date. Let us say that is final.
    16:32:20 on < techno_freak> so let us first decide what this PyCon India be like, what do we expect to do, whom do we expect to cater to
    16:32:29 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, +1
    16:32:33 on <@anandbpillai> +1
    16:32:39 on <@anandbpillai> techno_freak +11
    16:32:57 on < jace> since this is the first pycon india, there will have to be a newbie track, but that can only be a side event (even if an important one)
    16:32:59 on <@Khmar> Okay. As far as my understanding goes, it's not going to be a purely evangelical or newbie event.
    16:33:14 on <@ramkrsna> true
    16:33:21 on < falcon74> if we are calling this "PyCon India", i presume the format/content would be (/should be) same as "PyCon"
    16:33:26 on <@anandbpillai> I suggest we aim for the students, i mean target the newbies because they are the most enthusiastic
    16:33:28 on < baijum> No need to consider international people, this is going to be an "Indian" PyCon like PyCon Italy, PyCon Brazil etc.
    16:33:36 on <@ramkrsna> falcon74, yes
    16:33:38 on < rmz102> Guys target somewhere between 250-400 only for the first meet
    16:33:43 on <@anandbpillai> target them as audience, but content can be aimed at a higher level
    16:33:45 on < techno_freak> we cater to what Indian community needs as of now wrt Python
    16:33:46 on -!- rmathews` [n=rm@59.92.54.28] has joined #bangpypers
    16:33:55 on <@Khmar> Let's say 300.
    16:33:59 on <@Khmar> And now, keep that out of the way.
    16:34:01 on < G0SUB> Khmar: I like the idea... but think about this. The FOSS.in guys have trouble in organising dev oriented conferences which are much more general than 
                         Python. how will we do it differently?
    16:34:03 on <@Khmar> content wise, what are we planning?
    16:34:05 on <@ramkrsna> baijum, we would give emphasis more on indian speakers. We also need to have a CFP
    16:34:19 on < baijum> ramkrsna: ok
    16:34:41 on <@anandbpillai> +1 ramkrsna
    16:34:44 on < rmathews`> ramkrsna: -1 for the Indian speakers part.
    16:34:53 on < jace> if we're discussing students and newbies, lawgon should be involved.
    16:35:01 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: Given our scale, I think most of the speakers will be Indian.
    16:35:03 on <@anandbpillai> can someone wake him up
    16:35:04 on < rmathews`> anandbpillai: why?  the pycon part is important, not the india part
    16:35:06 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: this indian, non indian thing is secondary.
    16:35:18 on < jace> afaik, he has more experience with that demographic than any of us.
    16:35:24 on < rmathews`> Khmar: true, but that shouldn't be a criteria for selecting speakers.
    16:35:37 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: Yes, but the distinction will be theoretical.
    16:35:41 on -!- Netsplit kornbluth.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: rmathews
    16:35:42 on < techno_freak> we also need to show what Indian python shops are doing as well
    16:35:44 on <@anandbpillai> I think he was meaning like we don't do it the foss dot in way, i.e celebrity talkers from abroad. i agree with that
    16:35:53 on < techno_freak> +1
    16:35:54 on < G0SUB> why don't we admit that we are choosing the name PyCon just like that and don't want to attempt something like the real PyCons....
    16:35:59 on < rmathews`> Khmar: yet, important
    16:36:03 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, well i agree, not being a racist here :D
    16:36:06 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: that's unfriendly
    16:36:12 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: Yup. And I afree with you.
    16:36:14 on -!- baijum1 [n=baijum@122.167.115.63] has quit [Connection timed out]
    16:36:33 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: we wants to be cool too, stop being a party pooper.
    16:36:34 on <@Khmar> G0SUB: Let's not call it PyCon then.
    16:36:47 on < G0SUB> let's just think about organising a Python Conference.
    16:36:49 on <@Khmar> But don't let hair splitting over the name suck up time.
    16:36:56 on < G0SUB> this PyCon name is giving me jitters
    16:36:57 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    16:37:05 on <@anandbpillai> international participation is good for marketing and visibility, but we need to be practical abt it since this is the 1st edition and we may not 
                                be able to attract a lot of international visibility right from the world go
    16:37:09 on < jace> G0SUB: a Python Conference can't be abbreviated to PyCon?
    16:37:20 on <@anandbpillai> so by design we will have more indian speakers i guess
    16:37:21 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: me too, actually at first, but then maybe the added pressure will create something better
    16:37:24 on <@Khmar> Please... No more discussion about using the name or not. Not till later.
    16:37:33 on < G0SUB> jace: yes, but that name is already established as an uber Python Conference
    16:37:33 on < jace> Khmar: +1
    16:37:33 on < rmathews`> Khmar: okay
    16:37:39 on -!- mib_x3pwqu [i=7c7dbd2e@gateway/web/ajax/mibbit.com/x-d53a866ad1bd9232] has joined #BangPypers
    16:37:49 on < rmathews`> topics? speakers?
    16:37:52 on < techno_freak> so more indian speakers, then..
    16:37:56 on < techno_freak> what's the theme?
    16:37:58 on < rmathews`> techno_freak: grrrr.
    16:38:00 on <@Khmar> So, we'll have some dev stuff. Some newbie stuff and what else?
    16:38:06 on -!- anandology_ [n=anandolo@115.240.252.194] has quit [Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)]
    16:38:09 on < baijum> Actually Python developers and PSF encourage to use "PyCon" name
    16:38:09 on < rmathews`> Khmar: -1 for the newbie stuff.
    16:38:09 on < G0SUB> otherwise, I am perfectly fine with a python conference. the name just creates some false expectations
    16:38:10 on < jace> Khmar: +1
    16:38:13 on < abhinav> tutorials?
    16:38:24 on < jace> dang up arrow
    16:38:31 on <@anandbpillai> GOSUB, please drop the name reference.
    16:38:32 on < techno_freak> workshops?
    16:38:34 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, rmathews`  The rationale behind was to encourage python , how a local communities like bangpypers, chennaipy can help spread python with in india
    16:38:40 on < jace> the question of indian or foreign speakers should be left to the speakers.
    16:38:47 on < jace> no need to focus on one type
    16:38:50 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: yeah
    16:38:51 on <@anandbpillai> +1 jace
    16:38:59 on <@anandbpillai> that was what i was trying to say
    16:39:09 on <@ramkrsna> jace, fair and simple call for cfp.
    16:39:09 on < abhinav> code sprints?
    16:39:10 on < jace> we're clearly after an indian /audience/, since the conf is in india
    16:39:10 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: it's a zero, btw. not O :)
    16:39:18 on <@Khmar> The Indianness is a non-issue. Let's just keep that out of the way. When we get a chance to be racist, we'll bring it back on the table.
    16:39:20 on <@Khmar> :)
    16:39:26 on <@ramkrsna> heh
    16:39:31 on -!- rmathews [n=rm@59.92.54.28] has joined #bangpypers
    16:39:34 on < jace> so can we decide who the audience is?
    16:39:38 on <@Khmar> So, can we attract a dev crowd?
    16:39:46 on <@Khmar> Or should we focus more on the newbie thing?
    16:39:49 on <@anandbpillai> -1 Khmar we should not aim for it
    16:39:50 on < jace> taking a maxim from the advertising industry:
    16:39:51 on < rmz102> The only connection with India is that its happening in India
    16:39:51 on < techno_freak> One is Beginners of Python
    16:39:52 on <@Khmar> What about things like coding sprints?
    16:39:53 on -!- electracool [n=chatzill@122.167.22.253] has joined #bangpypers
    16:39:54 on < G0SUB> jace: newbies. mainly.
    16:39:57 on <@anandbpillai> i mean this should be about spreading awareness
    16:40:07 on < jace> the lifestyles portrayed in the typical ad only apply to 10% of the target demographic
    16:40:11 on <@anandbpillai> no omlettes in 1st edition ;)
    16:40:13 on < rmathews`> ramkrsna: hmm ... maybe the Python groups can continue evangelizing, and leave the conference for users by users?  I'm just saying, targetting talks 
                             for newbies generally brings the quality of things down, and it seems to happen all the time.  Given that this is a conference, not an unconference, 
                             the direction it is given now, will decide how much of a success this will be.
    16:40:27 on < jace> the remaining 90% are expected to aspire to be like the 10% and to thereby identify with the ad
    16:40:28 on < G0SUB> Khmar: it's masochism to think that you will be able to attract quality dev crowd in India
    16:40:34 on < techno_freak> well, you have to cover variety of people
    16:40:35 on <@ramkrsna> rmathews, I agree with you
    16:40:40 on < jace> aspiration is key
    16:40:46 on < techno_freak> when you are beginning
    16:40:49 on <@Khmar> Perhaps but the pessimism is not going to help us. :)
    16:41:01 on < rmathews`> +1 for the code sprints
    16:41:11 on < jace> a newbie-focused event will lose enthusiasm very quickly
    16:41:20 on < techno_freak> so we have beginner talks for newbiews, and code sprints for the seasoned
    16:41:21 on <@Khmar> Even non-python people who are into open source might be interested in a technically involved session rather than a newbie thing.
    16:41:23 on <@anandbpillai> can we not have a specific target audience in mind ? i mean let that be hazy... i think it will help proceedings
    16:41:23 on < abhinav> +1 jace
    16:41:33 on <@anandbpillai> the python developer is our audience
    16:41:33 on <@Khmar> +1 anandbpillai
    16:41:38 on <@ramkrsna> rmathews, I didnt say anything about lowering standards. we need to have diffrent tracks, newbie, intermediate and expert/gurus track
    16:41:39 on < jace> people supporting the event, even those in this room, want the event to represent their own aspirations
    16:41:41 on <@anandbpillai> let him be new or raw or old
    16:41:46 on < techno_freak> anandbpillai, like "already existing" python programmers in India?
    16:41:55 on <@anandbpillai> kind of, right
    16:42:02 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: Or good programmers looking for a FOSS atmosphere.
    16:42:06 on <@anandbpillai> i mean guys who know something abt python at least, not raw newbies
    16:42:07 on < rmathews`> ramkrsna: the tracks idea sounds nice, and I did think about it, but it's tricky to get right.
    16:42:08 on < techno_freak> leave FOSS out of these
    16:42:11 on < baijum> may be 1 day for newbies (tutorial day) 1 day conf day and last day sprint ?
    16:42:18 on < rmathews`> jace: :D
    16:42:19 on <@anandbpillai> +1 baijum
    16:42:21 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: tracks?
    16:42:24 on <@ramkrsna> rmathews, we would also need 'tutorials'
    16:42:25 on <@Khmar> +1 baijum
    16:42:28 on <@anandbpillai> good idea, implementable  i guess
    16:42:28 on < rmathews`> Khmar: yes.
    16:42:29 on < jace> target the uber coders, folks who are changing the face of python itself, while leaving some space for newbies
    16:42:32 on <@Khmar> That's a 'neat' distinction.
    16:42:37 on < rmz102> I think itsbetter to have seperate tracks
    16:42:38 on < jace> and by the time event happens, it'll water itself down to the right proportions.
    16:42:41 on < techno_freak> baijum, sprint needs to be in the middle, so we have one more day to polish up :D
    16:42:47 on < G0SUB> jace: name 10 uber python coders from India
    16:42:52 on < jace> G0SUB: irrelevent
    16:42:55 on <@anandbpillai> jace, u mean the pypy folks for example ?
    16:42:58 on <@Khmar> rmz102: Can you clarify what you mean by tracks? Parallel sessions?
    16:42:58 on < G0SUB> jace: haha
    16:43:06 on < rmathews`> Khmar: yes.
    16:43:08 on < rmz102> yes parallel sessions
    16:43:17 on -!- Netsplit kornbluth.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: rmathews
    16:43:22 on <@Khmar> That'll require more resources to keep going smoothly methinks.
    16:43:28 on < jace> G0SUB: the uber programmers could come from anywhere in the world. it doesn't matter.
    16:43:31 on -!- Netsplit over, joins: rmathews
    16:43:31 on < rmathews`> Khmar: I think I saw that in the UK PyCon too.  Different rooms with simultanoues talks.
    16:43:39 on < jace> what matters is the aspiration quality of the event
    16:43:43 on < rmz102> You can have parallel sessions, do not divide them into newbie or experienced
    16:43:46 on < rmz102> just halls
    16:43:50 on < G0SUB> jace: I agree
    16:43:52 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, please do not go off topic, help us plan it. I know you are a uber coder
    16:43:52 on < techno_freak> too many parallel talks everything goes out of hand
    16:43:53 on <@anandbpillai> +1 rmz102
    16:43:53 on <@ramkrsna> :D
    16:43:54 on < baijum> BTW, for other PyCons, including EuroPython, they used to conduct sprint on last day
    16:43:55 on <@Khmar> Although we can accomplish more. I think it would better if we switch to that if we have sufficient topics
    16:43:59 on <@Khmar> Hmmmm.
    16:43:59 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: lol
    16:44:01 on <@Khmar> you're right
    16:44:02 on < jace> anandbpillai: i'm not very familiar with pypy, unfortunately.
    16:44:03 on <@Khmar> +1 rmz102
    16:44:04 on <@anandbpillai> let others do the tagging, just present content
    16:44:06 on <@anandbpillai> :)
    16:44:20 on <@Khmar> Okay...
    16:44:24 on <@Khmar> So.. let me summarise this.
    16:44:31 on -!- n3oo3n [n=n3oo3n@gaia.xinh.org] has joined #bangpypers
    16:44:33 on < techno_freak> baijum, the crowd comes on the first day and the last day, so have the sprint in the middle so we are at peace ;-)
    16:44:35 on <@Khmar> So that we can focus a little.
    16:44:38 on <@anandbpillai> ok, yield Khmar :)
    16:44:41 on < falcon74> I think 'GOSUB's question is relevant...  "name 10 uber python coders in India"... i'd think that atleast 80% of that 10, are in this channel at the 
                            moment. Let's not make this 'elitist'... but 'inclusive'.
    16:44:58 on < G0SUB> falcon74: that's my idea.
    16:44:59 on < rmz102> we can always move talks based on expected audience levels
    16:45:05 on < baijum> Khmar: can you check we are on agenda ?
    16:45:05 on < rmz102> across halls
    16:45:11 on <@Khmar> We aren't really. :)
    16:45:13 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, wait , I guess we still need to discuss the rationale behind the conference
    16:45:18 on < falcon74> which doesn't mean, that dilute content to make it anything else...
    16:45:23 on <@Khmar> Okay okay!
    16:45:27 on <@anandbpillai> i think that is fine, cmon this is a web-conf, we are broadly on the agenda
    16:45:28 on < baijum> Khmar: so, please do a moderation :)
    16:45:28 on < techno_freak> Khmar, declare tentative "Focus of PyCon"
    16:45:48 on < rmathews`> Khmar: maybe you should just note down the pressure points this time, and call for another meet after discussing this on the mailing list/wiki
    16:45:53 on <@Khmar> I am.
    16:46:00 on < jace> falcon74: if you start elitist but egalitarian (ie, not explicitly excluding anyone), you'll automatically come down to normal levels. but if you start 
                        low, you won't rise up.
    16:46:05 on <@Khmar> But I think we have some meat that I think will be useful to summarise.
    16:46:07 on <@anandbpillai> yes, folks, this is not going to be the meeting, but first of many meetings i would say
    16:46:09 on <@ramkrsna> Lets talk about the audience , types of audience and different fields they come from
    16:46:16 on < rmathews`> Khmar: meet?
    16:46:23 on <@ramkrsna> most of them students, developers, sys admins
    16:46:24 on <@Khmar> i mean content.
    16:46:28 on <@anandbpillai> +1 ramkrsna
    16:46:37 on < rmathews`> Khmar: just checking.
    16:46:45 on <@Khmar> Okay. So the broad plan as I understand is that we invite presentations and just schedule them properly.
    16:46:52 on -!- Netsplit kornbluth.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: rmathews
    16:46:52 on <@Khmar> No real lines between them.
    16:46:56 on < techno_freak> students who want to know about Python, people who already code in Python
    16:46:57 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, yes
    16:47:00 on <@Khmar> We parallelise based on resources and number of presentations.
    16:47:06 on < jace> Khmar: "yes, but"
    16:47:07 on < techno_freak> yes
    16:47:14 on -!- Netsplit over, joins: rmathews
    16:47:14 on <@anandbpillai> i would expect 50% students, 40% python developers (at work, IT admin , script kiddie etc) and 10% uber coders/guys who do Python for a living
    16:47:16 on <@Khmar> If it takes up all 3 days, well and good
    16:47:20 on < techno_freak> but we need to have a theme, say our target audience is THIS
    16:47:21 on < rmathews`> just a thought, I enjoy those talks best which are a lil (just a lil over my head) gets me all excited, but the ones which just cover old ground make me nod offf
    16:47:25 on <@Khmar> If not, we can have an explicit 'sprint' day.
    16:47:30 on < G0SUB> rmathews: is your connection _so_ bad?
    16:47:37 on <@ramkrsna> developers again fall into system programmers, web programmers...
    16:47:45 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, +1
    16:47:46 on <@ramkrsna> ofcourse there is Django ;-)
    16:47:48 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: don't ask. :)
    16:47:51 on <@anandbpillai> do we need to discuss at that level ?
    16:47:55 on -!- electracool_ [n=chatzill@122.167.22.253] has joined #bangpypers
    16:47:58 on < techno_freak> we need Python for Web Development and Python for System Programming
    16:48:03 on <@Khmar> I think when we send out for papers, the topics will reflect the crowd that will come.
    16:48:09 on <@anandbpillai> from india i guess 80% of python programmers would fall to web programmer category
    16:48:15 on < techno_freak> anandbpillai, we need to separate web, otherwise it will eat up the whole conf
    16:48:18 on <@ramkrsna> anandbpillai, thats a higher level view
    16:48:23 on <@anandbpillai> so we should focus on web part of it on that
    16:48:32 on < techno_freak> that's to decide
    16:48:33 on < rmz102> anandbpillai:not necessarily
    16:48:39 on < rmathews`> okay, is there anyone from Google here?
    16:48:43 on <@anandbpillai> separate track for that ? (Django, pylons etc)
    16:48:48 on <@anandbpillai> btbytes ?
    16:48:49 on <@ramkrsna> so keeping out audiance in mind. web programming might get a lot of papers
    16:48:49 on < techno_freak> Web Frameworks
    16:48:55 on < rmathews`> what are the odds of getting Guido to make a trip to see elephants and what not?
    16:48:56 on <@anandbpillai> you are best to comment on it (btbytes)
    16:49:13 on -!- Netsplit kornbluth.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: rmathews
    16:49:13 on <@ramkrsna> rmathews, I would love guido to be here
    16:49:19 on < G0SUB> rmathews: don't even think of getting GvR here
    16:49:21 on < rmz102> I think it is premature to discuss content right now
    16:49:36 on < jace> G0SUB: why aim too low?
    16:49:38 on <@anandbpillai> yield rmz102 :)
    16:49:38 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: what did you eat, man ... think happy happy joy joy
    16:49:38 on < rmz102> first look at the macro issues
    16:49:41 on < techno_freak> ok...
    16:49:42 on <@Khmar> We'll come to GvR later.
    16:49:48 on < techno_freak> we have some clue of theme
    16:49:50 on < techno_freak> what next..
    16:49:55 on < baijum> Sponsorship ?
    16:49:57 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, you could invite knuth here, you know him
    16:49:57 on <@Khmar> I think the theme is broadly done.
    16:50:01 on < G0SUB> jace: I mean isn't that irrelevant at this moment?
    16:50:05 on <@Khmar> whois G0SUB
    16:50:08 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: DEK is too old
    16:50:10 on < techno_freak> Reminder: This is Meet #1, we will get into details based next time
    16:50:11 on < rmz102> Look at how much can be raised for the conference
    16:50:19 on < G0SUB> Khmar: you forgot the /
    16:50:20 on < rmz102> where do you want to do it
    16:50:21 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, you do not know G0SUB
    16:50:21 on <@Khmar> Okay. Theme is done then.
    16:50:24 on < jace> G0SUB: yes, but let it pass.
    16:50:28 on < techno_freak> # Venue
    16:50:35 on <@ramkrsna> okey lets get back to the topic
    16:50:43 on < rmz102> in Bangalore the choices are
    16:50:45 on < techno_freak> Where do you want it to happen?
    16:50:46 on <@Khmar> theme is done.
    16:50:47 on < rmathews`> companies with Python products?  I can ask someone from office to talk about Quillpad, if that isn't too hush hush.
    16:50:49 on < techno_freak> Do we have hosts?
    16:50:57 on < baijum> Bangalore
    16:50:59 on <@Khmar> I'm not sure...
    16:51:01 on < techno_freak> rmathews`, please stick with the topic
    16:51:03 on <@Khmar> Where do you usually hold conferences?
    16:51:06 on <@Khmar> IISc. ?
    16:51:11 on < rmz102> IISc, any of the 5 star hotels
    16:51:11 on <@Khmar> I didn't attend foss.in
    16:51:14 on <@anandbpillai> +1 rmathews, would be nice to have a track for new Python products, so to speak
    16:51:16 on < G0SUB> rmathews`: if Quillpad is not FOSS, how's that relevant?
    16:51:26 on < jace> lots of venues, but if you want IISc JN Tata, you have to book now.
    16:51:29 on < madrazr> IISC would be easier
    16:51:34 on < G0SUB> if I can't see the source, how can I learn?
    16:51:35 on < jace> lots of smaller venues within IISc too.
    16:51:36 on < madrazr> err... better
    16:51:38 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: Haha, non sequitor.  QP is in Python.
    16:51:39 on < techno_freak> IISc is costlier if am not wrong
    16:51:43 on < techno_freak> i mean the audi
    16:51:44 on <@Khmar> IISc. looks like a popular choice
    16:51:46 on < baijum> +1 for IISc
    16:51:49 on <@anandbpillai> Folks, this is not a FOSS event, i dont think we have to enforce that anything discussed here is FOSS
    16:51:51 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: Let's leave that thread please?
    16:51:56 on < techno_freak> anandbpillai, +100
    16:52:00 on < rmz102> JN Tata was costing around 40 k a day a few years back
    16:52:01 on <@anandbpillai> it has to be Python and if it is FOSS, good, but not exclusively FOSS
    16:52:03 on < rmathews`> Khmar: okay, this is going too fast for me. :(
    16:52:15 on <@ramkrsna> okey folks. I would like to stop the discussions for a while
    16:52:26 on < baijum> Any other venue suggestion ?
    16:52:27 on <@Khmar> I think it'd be good to have some non FOSS python too.
    16:52:28 on < techno_freak> are we looking at a proper Audi, or some classrooms are good enough with a central audi?
    16:52:39 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: how will it help if some company comes and talks about this cool non-free app written in Python?
    16:52:42 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, can you summarize the conference rationale
    16:52:43 on <@anandbpillai> hmmm, venue so soon
    16:52:47 on < rmz102> you can look at cheaper places like Bangalore colleges which will come between 8 and 15 k
    16:52:51 on < rmz102> a day
    16:52:52 on < jace> kitchen duty again. will catch up later.
    16:52:58 on <@ramkrsna> folks venue can be discussed a bit later
    16:53:03 on < techno_freak> it's on Python, not Python+FOSS
    16:53:07 on <@Khmar> Colleges look like a popular choice.
    16:53:07 on < rmathews`> G0SUB: actually you do have a point, lets get to this later.
    16:53:16 on <@Khmar> Any others?
    16:53:17 on < G0SUB> rmathews`: yeah :)
    16:53:17 on < techno_freak> ??
    16:53:21 on <@anandbpillai> G0SUB: how if the cool, non-free webapp is an online service, very usable like facebook, but can't be made free ?
    16:53:28 on < baijum> ramkrsna: We will  be required to book earlier for venu like IISc
    16:53:34 on < abhinav> what about IIMB?
    16:53:35 on <@anandbpillai> G0SUB: you will flag it down ? i dont think so
    16:53:42 on <@Khmar> IIMB, IISc.
    16:53:44 on <@Khmar> PESIT?
    16:53:45 on < madrazr> hello all, I come from BMSCE, if you guys are Ok, I can talk to our college management
    16:53:45 on < rmz102> Go for a central place
    16:53:51 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: makes sense if some of it is free. facebook has thrift. which rocks.
    16:53:53 on < n3oo3n> what about conf dates ?
    16:53:56 on < rmz102> Pesit is a good choice
    16:53:59 on < rmz102> will come free
    16:54:02 on < madrazr> we have one central Audi, 2 small Audis and classrooms
    16:54:02 on < techno_freak> so it is favoured to be in Bangalore? final.. let leave the details to next meeting on Venue fixing
    16:54:03 on < rmathews`> thought for the hour:  given that everything is premature right now, how about just having a free for all and being all civilized later?
    16:54:13 on <@anandbpillai> G0SUB: yes, i meant at least if part is free, we are not going to discuss any full proprietary stuff here
    16:54:23 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, +1
    16:54:24 on <@anandbpillai> G0SUB: If for example, the client is open and free,
    16:54:37 on < n3oo3n> how much crowd is expected ?
    16:54:39 on < G0SUB> anandbpillai: well, _then_ I am all for it. I should be able to take something home.
    16:54:45 on < techno_freak> ## Venue - Bangalore - Details for specialised meeting ##
    16:54:48 on < rmathews`> anandbpillai: yes, I was interested more in the aspects of machine learning and AI with python rather than the QP product itself.
    16:54:53 on < techno_freak> ## Sponsors ##
    16:55:05 on < rmathews`> n3oo3n: we don't know yet.
    16:55:09 on < rmz102> Sponsors will depend on how much you want to raise
    16:55:12 on < madrazr> and BMSCE is very much in the heart of the City - Bull Temple Road, Basavanagudi
    16:55:19 on <@anandbpillai> G0SUB: yes, that is what i meant, let us not drag the topic, hope i am clear enough
    16:55:20 on <@Khmar> Any suggestions for a venue other than colleges?
    16:55:22 on < techno_freak> which will indirectly depend on what all we're going to do
    16:56:07 on < rmz102> you need to also look at we are in middle of recession and some of the usual suspects may not cough up much
    16:56:09 on <@Khmar> I guess not.
    16:56:10 on <@anandbpillai> rmathews: I think people would like to take something back home, so if the product does not have an open client API at least, it may not be well  received
    16:56:12 on <@ramkrsna> Okey for the venue, we could set up volunteer groups, to go to each of these places and find out the rates| bandwidth | facilities ( speaker room,  class rooms)
    16:56:17 on < techno_freak> We need Sponsors for [1] Speaker Accommodation [2] Logistics [3] Venue [4] Media [5] Conference Kit?
    16:56:20 on < n3oo3n> place we can decide after getting idea about the head count
    16:56:23 on <@Khmar> anandbpillai: This is really off topic. :)
    16:56:32 on < baijum> Hotel ?
    16:56:37 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, lets roll back a bit
    16:56:39 on <@anandbpillai> Khmar: I am not in the main topic thread ;)
    16:56:45 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, to.. ?
    16:56:57 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, to the conference it self
    16:56:59 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: that's a decent summary.
    16:57:03 on < techno_freak> ok
    16:57:14 on <@Khmar> ramkrsna: I think the birds eye view of the conference is done.
    16:57:17 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, then raise the topic you want to be discussed
    16:57:18 on < rmz102> baijum: Hotel? you mean for stay or for conference
    16:57:38 on <@Khmar> series of talks which we parallelise, and a separate day for sprints if the talks don't fill the thing.
    16:57:40 on <@ramkrsna> CFP and a Open review Process
    16:57:42 on <@anandbpillai> Hotels would be damn expensive for a conf like this
    16:57:54 on <@ramkrsna> How many of you think having a CFP is a good idea
    16:57:59 on <@anandbpillai> +1 CFP
    16:57:59 on < techno_freak> +1
    16:58:07 on < rmz102> yes it will cost between 500 and 1500 a day per person for 200+
    16:58:08 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: +1
    16:58:09 on < btbytes> +1 for CFP
    16:58:19 on <@Khmar> CFP?
    16:58:24 on <@anandbpillai> call for proposals
    16:58:27 on <@Khmar> Ah okay.
    16:58:30 on <@Khmar> +1 CFP
    16:58:36 on <@ramkrsna> Call For papers/propsals/ presentation
    16:58:45 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, CFP will help us decide upon the availability of speaker resources as well
    16:58:47 on <@anandbpillai> +10 ramkrsna :)
    16:58:53 on <@Khmar> That's the clearest way of getting participations.

    16:59:12 on <@anandbpillai> CFP is also a good marketing tool , the web URL of the CFP is perhaps the first word out of a conf
    16:59:16 on <@Khmar> If we are going to start off with a CFP, we'd need some kind of site, central point.
    16:59:17 on < rmathews`> how does the CfP process work?  if we don't get responses will be have time to find alternatives?
    16:59:20 on <@anandbpillai> happens most of the tim
    16:59:21 on <@anandbpillai> time
    16:59:23 on <@Khmar> So we'll have to work on that first.
    16:59:30 on < rmathews`> in.pycon.org?
    16:59:32 on < techno_freak> Important: We want a dedicated mailing list
    16:59:38 on <@ramkrsna> CFP's also need have a open review process, unlike other indian conferences
    16:59:42 on < rmathews`> techno_freak: no no, not yet.
    16:59:49 on <@ramkrsna> I'm +1 for a Open review Process
    16:59:54 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: We'll keep that on the same level as the site.
    16:59:57 on < G0SUB> rmathews`: why not? (a mailing list)
    16:59:58 on <@Khmar> +1 Open review process.
    17:00:04 on <@Khmar> But how do we go about it?
    17:00:07 on <@anandbpillai> +1 for open review, but we need a review committee then...

    17:00:28 on < rmathews`> what's open review?
    17:00:40 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, the pycon does a open review process. they have 3 votes for a paper to be accepted
    17:00:42 on < techno_freak> everybody knows what has come, what's been selected and why
    17:00:51 on < techno_freak> plus you can vote in and out a proposal
    17:00:51 on <@anandbpillai> where is review done in pycon
    17:00:53 on < rmathews`> review of talk proposals?  or are we asking for full fledged papers now?
    17:01:03 on <@anandbpillai> i mean is there a committee ?
    17:01:05 on <@Khmar> Well, a committe can be formed via our list and the wiki.

    17:01:23 on <@ramkrsna> anandbpillai, no, most of the volunteers do it and vote it via their conference system

    17:02:40 on < rmathews`> another idea:  all those companies listed on the wiki at python.org can be tapped for sponsorships, speakers, etc.
    17:02:47 on < baijum1> PyCon software has review system
    17:02:57 on < btbytes> The PyCon Conf tool is current and maintained.
    17:03:02 on < btbytes> +1 for Pycon Conf tool
    17:03:04 on <@anandbpillai> ramkrsna - selection of review members must be an open process
    17:03:16 on <@Khmar> Hello btbytes. didn't notice you till now. :)
    17:03:34 on < techno_freak> +1 for pyconf tool
    17:03:35 on < rmathews`> anandbpillai: I'd say have review members, plus opinions from outsiders too.  (I'd like to have my say.)
    17:03:43 on < svaksha> tell reviewers to register via the pycon system (or which ever you decide) and they can vote openly

    17:03:58 on < rmathews`> svaksha: are you Khmar?
    17:04:02 on <@ramkrsna> anandbpillai, yeah. the point being, eg. I can say if a system programming proposal  is good or I will suck with web programming stuff
    17:04:03 on < svaksha> no
    17:04:20 on <@ramkrsna> rmathews`, lol
    17:04:42 on < rmathews`> ramkrsna: they're on the wiki and mailing list, thought they were the same person
    17:04:52 on <@Khmar> So, CFP via a site, get the proposals, use the pycon software to review them and shortlist. Right?
    17:05:03 on < baijum1> We will require someone to setup this tool
    17:05:05 on < techno_freak> right
    17:05:08 on <@Khmar> rmathews`: I'm 'Noufal Ibrahim' on the list.
    17:05:09 on < baijum1> any takers ?
    17:05:18 on <@Khmar> baijum1: We'd need volunteers for many functional areas.

    17:09:47 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: As they come in. I don't expect too many so we don't want to publish proportions upfront.
    17:09:49 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, as in time durations
    17:09:53 on < techno_freak> yes
    17:09:54 on <@ramkrsna> ?
    17:10:05 on < techno_freak> or what's the % of importance
    17:10:06 on <@Khmar> What do you think?
    17:10:25 on < techno_freak> Khmar, when you make a CFP you also need to say what are the diff type of expectations

    17:10:33 on < rmathews`> this has been fun, but I'm sleepy ... Khmar, you'll be posting minutes or something similar to the list right?
    17:10:46 on <@ramkrsna> another thing, do the tutorail owners wanna charge for the tutorial they are doing
    17:10:59 on <@Khmar> Oh yes. I think we can do that techno_freak. I just do't want to decide right now that we'll have 'x' full length and 'y' lightning.

    17:13:29 on <@Khmar> Unemployed meaning, they don't have an employee id. Makes sense. :)

    17:13:42 on < techno_freak> that's what everybody thinks
    17:13:57 on <@Khmar> Okay. Let's not get into Free software terminology here.
    17:14:00 on <@Khmar> +1 for reg. fee.
    17:14:01 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, there are some professional python tutors here
    17:14:08 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: hmm
    17:14:09 on < techno_freak> actually you cant fix delegate fees until you know sponsorship and cost
    17:14:14 on < baijum1> Can we accept donation ?

    17:14:22 on < techno_freak> baijum1, sure :)
    17:14:25 on <@Khmar> Do we have anything like stalls or something?
    17:14:25 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, so we can ask them to have reduced rates for PyCom
    17:14:34 on < techno_freak> good point Khmar
    17:14:36 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: may be
    17:14:49 on < techno_freak> Are we allowing paid stalls? if so, to whom? conditions?
    17:14:53 on <@Khmar> There might be professional tutoris like ramkrsna said who might be interested in pitching themselves.
    17:15:03 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: Highest bidder. ;)
    17:15:19 on < techno_freak> you dont want someone unrelated being allowed
    17:15:27 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, that will give them an audiance to reachout and a professional atmosphere for the conference itself
    17:15:27 on < G0SUB> Khmar: yeah, and what will ramkrsna teach?
    17:15:41 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: makes sense
    17:15:49 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, :q! a quick guide to emacs perhaps
    17:15:55 on < techno_freak> ha ha
    17:15:56 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: If they pay enough, we can make it related. :)
    17:15:57 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: lol
    17:16:02 on <@Khmar> Kidding.
    17:16:04 on <@Khmar> But seriously...
    17:16:16 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: make that an intro to viper mode. i bet you can do that well.
    17:16:16 on <@Khmar> Do we want stalls at all? Will they kill the atmosphere?
    17:16:26 on <@Khmar> Perhaps a general area where people can pitch commercial services?
    17:16:38 on <@Khmar> Rather than formal stalls.
    17:16:39 on < techno_freak> commercial with relation to python :P
    17:16:50 on < techno_freak> or hunt for people to fill their python jobs ;)
    17:16:53 on < baijum2> Sponsors may ask for Stalls
    17:16:56 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: Yes. I expect it will mostly be training and we can't really police them.
    17:17:02 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: That's a good thing. Isn't it?
    17:17:11 on <@Khmar> baijum2: Good point.
    17:17:16 on < techno_freak> Python training is no problem for us
    17:17:22 on < techno_freak> baijum1, they will of course
    17:17:26 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, an Industry tack is not a bad idea at all
    17:17:30 on <@ramkrsna> track
    17:17:45 on < techno_freak> actually we need one, to show that we indeed have python jobs, really good ones
    17:18:00 on <@ramkrsna> how companies use python in their mainstream business
    17:18:11 on <@Khmar> Ah. A track is a good idea. I was thinking of an open area with some small stalls, open boards, chairs etc where the people can pitch their services but 
                         making it a track is good reuse of infrastructure.
    17:18:17 on < jace> back, briefly
    17:18:27 on < rmz102> sorry to interrupt, how many bangalore guys are here?
    17:18:31 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: Yes. I think it's a good thing to advertise the business value of the language.
    17:18:45 on <@Khmar> Works as evangelism.
    17:18:50 on <@Khmar> Can I get a vote on the stalls thing?
    17:19:13 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, stall are not a bad idea, as long as they give out swags with pycon india logo in them ;-)
    17:19:14 on < techno_freak> we will think about it when venue gets fixed ;)
    17:19:24 on < G0SUB> btw, I am going to talk on list comprehensions, iterators and generators. if somebody else was thinking the same, you might as well **** off :)
    17:19:24 on < techno_freak> Stickers!!!!!
    17:19:25 on < rmz102> Khmar:Stall will also depend on the venue
    17:19:35 on < techno_freak> G0SUB, LOL
    17:19:42 on < G0SUB> dibs on that topic.
    17:19:47 on <@ramkrsna> G0SUB, send in a CFP, we'll decide
    17:19:51 on <@Khmar> rmz102: or a comparable equivalent.
    17:20:03 on <@Khmar> rmz102: We could make them desks if we're at a college.
    17:20:05 on < G0SUB> ramkrsna: yeah, right :)
    17:20:11 on <@Khmar> I'm more interested in what people think of the idea.
    17:20:14 on < techno_freak> baijum1, get lots of stickers from PyCon :D
    17:20:37 on < G0SUB> baijum1: are you attending PyCon?
    17:20:38 on < baijum2> techno_freak: Sure :)
    17:20:42 on <@Khmar> Or should we just have a 'industry' track and keep that part of the whole conference. That will be good for the show but I think sponsors will want more 
                         like baijum2 said.
    17:20:46 on <@ramkrsna> okey now lets move to the next topic " Venue City "
    17:20:47 on < techno_freak> i have one ramkrsna brought last year
    17:20:52 on < baijum2> G0SUB: yes, we three from BangPypers
    17:20:53 on < jace> imo, content areas of the event: (a) newbies -- introduction to what is already standard, (b) technical -- for people interested in python itself, and (c) 
                        application -- how python gets used in the real world. i'm myself an application guy. i've made no contributions to core python and am unlikely to do so, 
                        but i will have good application stories. foss/no-foss is secondary to this main categorisation.
    17:21:00 on < techno_freak> Venue City = Bangalore, decided isn't it?
    17:21:01 on < jace> and now, gone again.
    17:21:03 on < G0SUB> baijum1: who else?
    17:21:06 on < baijum2> G0SUB: btbytes & Senthil
    17:21:14 on < G0SUB> baijum1: nice
    17:21:18 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: Yes
    17:21:21 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, fall back city ;-)
    17:21:24 on <@ramkrsna> chennai
    17:21:34 on < techno_freak> ya, but we need lawgon for that

    17:21:58 on <@Khmar> any others?
    17:22:01 on < techno_freak> Khmar, stalls on the next stage as venue sponsors get fixed up
    17:22:10 on <@ramkrsna> okey Bangalore for the venue
    17:22:15 on <@ramkrsna> +1 for bangalore
    17:22:15 on < techno_freak> stalls are inevitable and we will discuss that as it matures
    17:22:30 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: We can always adapt them based on venue. The question is whether we should give sponsors special areas for their own pitches during the 
                         conference or not?
    17:22:38 on <@Khmar> Makes sense techno_freak
    17:22:42 on <@Khmar> So, we're done with that.
    17:22:45 on < techno_freak> Khmar, sponsors will ask for stalls, they're giving money
    17:22:47 on <@Khmar> Venue city. Bangalore.
    17:22:48 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, stalls are good for industry PR
    17:22:53 on < baijum2> What about stalls for different Python User Groups ?
    17:22:58 on -!- anandology [n=anandolo@59.92.174.245] has quit []
    17:22:59 on <@Khmar> Okay. We're having Stalls.
    17:23:12 on < techno_freak> baijum1, we have 2, 3? i think one is enough for PUG
    17:23:15 on < baijum2> we don't have many user groups...
    17:23:24 on <@Khmar> baijum2: If enough of them show up with stallworthy crowd. One guy in a stall is a waste of space.
    17:23:42 on < techno_freak> we will have on spot resgistration to mailing list :P
    17:23:51 on <@Khmar> We can have a stall or something for 'local user groups' or something.
    17:24:00 on <@Khmar> What else?
    17:24:10 on <@Khmar> svaksha: You logging this?
    17:24:11 on < techno_freak> ok who's handling Media?
    17:24:12 on < baijum2> I agree
    17:24:24 on < techno_freak> we need more advertisement
    17:24:27 on < svaksha> Khmar: http://wiki.python.org/moin/BangPypers/IRCLogs/2009March03
    17:24:29 on <@Khmar>  :::: Media/Advertising ::::
    17:24:35 on  * baijum2 agreed one stall for alll groups idea by Khmar
    17:24:42 on <@ramkrsna> jace, we did discuss about a newbie, intermediate and expert tracks.   for students, developers, sys admins
    17:25:03 on < techno_freak> We need Media Volunteers
    17:25:14 on  * techno_freak looks at svaksha 
    17:25:21 on < jace> ramkrsna: that's different. content level vs type
    17:25:22 on  * svaksha can help partly
    17:25:22 on  * ramkrsna looks at rmz102 
    17:25:23 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: I think the details can be worked out on the mailing list.
    17:25:39 on <@Khmar> But we need some overall view.
    17:25:44 on < rmz102> ok we will give 2-3 magazines providing ads
    17:25:47 on  * G0SUB leaves. will read the list.
    17:25:49 on <@Khmar> Especially for the formal channels like mags.

    17:25:56 on < rmz102> DIQ, LFY I will talk to few others
    17:25:59 on < jace> anyway, i'll get back on that on the list

    17:26:25 on <@Khmar> rmz102: Can you own that up atleast tentatively?
    17:26:33 on < svaksha> by advertising do you  mean writeups about the event or something else ? juts to be clear
    17:26:33 on < rmz102> ok
    17:26:36 on < svaksha> just*
    17:26:44 on <@Khmar> baijum2: Yes. What kind of money are we looking at? We need to get a top level number so that we know what to try to raise.
    17:26:46 on < rmz102> We can have 3-4 magazines as media partners
    17:26:54 on < techno_freak> svaksha, mainly to let as many people to know about the event, it will attract sponsors
    17:26:56 on < rmz102> so they give free ads/write ups
    17:26:56 on <@Khmar> baijum2: And we need a date to decide whether this thing is going to fly or not.
    17:26:56 on  * svaksha assumes its called media publicity
    17:27:04 on <@ramkrsna> that will be great
    17:27:12 on < rmz102> you give them space to display magazines
    17:27:13 on < jace> do people read tech mags anymore?
    17:27:15 on <@Khmar> svaksha: I think you and rmz102 should discuss that. What do you guys think?
    17:27:24 on < techno_freak> +1
    17:27:26 on  * Khmar not very media saavy. I don't read mags and don't have a TV. :)
    17:27:32 on  * svaksha can help with media publicity
    17:27:33 on < baijum2> +1
    17:27:53 on < rmz102> I can help you with the sponsors
    17:27:56 on <@Khmar> rmz102: You're good that this. :)
    17:27:57 on < techno_freak> so if you want to involve in media/plublicity poke svaksha or rmz102
    17:28:06 on <@Khmar> Okay. That's settled.
    17:28:12 on <@ramkrsna> +1.
    17:28:13 on < rmz102> if we have clear plans on the exact funds to be raised
    17:28:21 on <@Khmar> I must say this is a breeze to moderate. You guys are really cool. :)
    17:28:28 on <@Khmar> Let's try to arrive at something...
    17:28:30 on < jace> asking google for adsense sponsorship may work better than magazines
    17:28:44 on <@Khmar> How much does it cost to rent IISc. facilities for 3 days? Roughly?
    17:28:46 on < rmz102> jace: I agree
    17:28:55 on <@Khmar> + computer facilities
    17:28:57 on < rmz102> IISC will be about 1.2 L
    17:29:01 on < rmz102> for 3 days
    17:29:02 on <@Khmar> + accomodatio for people
    17:29:03 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, IISC has issues with commercial stalls, stalls
    17:29:03 on < techno_freak> define IISc facility, you mean Tata audi?
    17:29:06 on < rmz102> that is just JN Tata
    17:29:20 on < rmz102> my rate offer is 2 years old
    17:29:21 on <@Khmar> We'll need more than just TN Tata. won't we?
    17:29:23 on < techno_freak> JN tata doesnt allow commercial ventures
    17:29:27 on <@ramkrsna> Khmar, IISC is good venue, but are we expecting that a big crowd
    17:29:40 on < rmz102> JN tata offers commercial stuff
    17:29:45 on < techno_freak> tata is enough one big hall and 3 small ones, grounds, lot of places to hand around, but..
    17:29:46 on <@Khmar> ramkrsna: Well, I'm just trying to get a figure of our cost.
    17:29:53 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: but?
    17:30:02 on <@Khmar> The suspense is killing me. :)
    17:30:03 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, "venue and sponsorship for next topic to be discussed
    17:30:06 on <@ramkrsna> next week
    17:30:06 on  * svaksha sleeps
    17:30:09 on < techno_freak> but they dont allow selling stuff, they throw away people at 7.30 pm
    17:30:21 on <@ramkrsna> yeah
    17:30:23 on <@Khmar> Hmmm.
    17:30:35 on < rmz102> I am not sure about 7.30 Pm
    17:30:37 on <@Khmar> Do we have any venues that will allow late night stuff?
    17:30:45 on < techno_freak> yes they do, i have been foss.in volunteer :P
    17:30:46 on < rmz102> but no one is selling anything that is billing
    17:30:56 on <@Khmar> ramkrsna: That will be too far away. I think we shoul dhave enough stuff generated here to beat around on the list. :)
    17:31:14 on < jace> why not an overnight venue on the outskirts? plenty choices these days
    17:31:25 on <@Khmar> jace: Like?
    17:31:29 on < rmz102> St Joseph's cpogge PG has a decent auditoriaum will house 200 people
    17:31:34 on < rmz102> and a min auditorium
    17:31:45 on < rmz102> and you cant get a central place
    17:31:54 on < jace> visthar, fireflies or the place info-activism camp used
    17:32:12 on <@Khmar> Interesting jace. Can you post some more details?
    17:32:13 on < jace> or the nimhans audi

    17:33:29 on <@Khmar> Okay.. alternate venues.
    17:33:31 on <@Khmar> But let's say..
    17:33:34 on <@Khmar> 1.5 L for 3 days
    17:33:38 on < rmz102> nimhans is pretty good
    17:33:45 on < rmz102> 1 l per day
    17:33:49 on <@Khmar> What about for computers and stuff? What do we need?
    17:33:55 on < rmz102> for main hall
    17:33:59 on < jace> Khmar: 1.5L is a lot of money for the venue
    17:34:17 on <@ramkrsna> can somebody post a mail regarding the possible venue and cost
    17:34:19 on < techno_freak> think it's TIME UP, we will meet again to discuss on a specific topic born out of this discussion
    17:34:19 on <@Khmar> rmz102 said that JN Tata is 1.1L per day
    17:34:23 on < rmz102> + 3 halls
    17:34:29 on <@Khmar> Okay...
    17:34:41 on <@ramkrsna> we will also need bandwidth for the conference
    17:34:41 on <@Khmar> I'll send a mail summarising our discussion and we can decide what to do from there
    17:34:42 on < techno_freak> please collect details on whatever possible
    17:34:45 on < techno_freak> in the mean time
    17:34:53 on < techno_freak> so we have more solid data next time

    17:35:12 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, was it decent enough at foss.in this time?
    17:35:14 on <@ramkrsna> o possibility of technology sponsor :: hadrware, bandwidth
    17:35:21 on < rmz102> Guys, the rate for Nimhans is 1 L per day you get 1 main halls and 3 smaller halls
    17:35:22 on < techno_freak> i was thinking of that
    17:35:23 on <@Khmar> ramkrsna: that's a good point.
    17:35:28 on <@Khmar> rmz102: Okay.
    17:35:34 on <@Khmar> So that's 3L let's say.

    17:35:47 on <@Khmar> What other costs will we incur?

    17:36:19 on <@Khmar> travel arrangements.
    17:36:21 on < techno_freak> depends upon the venue and stuff
    17:36:31 on <@Khmar> Venue is let's say IISc.
    17:36:43 on <@Khmar> I just want to get an idea so that we can do some calculations.
    17:36:56 on < jace> Khmar: we've done 8 barcamps now with zero cost for venue. community goodwill goes a long way if tapped well.
    17:37:10 on <@Khmar> that's cool.
    17:37:22 on < jace> even the bal bhawan in cubbon park is available for hire and can happily seat 300.
    17:37:23 on <@ramkrsna> jace, IIM is also a decent venue
    17:37:28 on < jace> we did an event there once.
    17:37:40 on <@ramkrsna> yeah the world information city ?
    17:37:44 on <@ramkrsna> 2005
    17:37:49 on < rmz102> well a conference will cost a lot; unconferences dont
    17:37:50 on < jace> ramkrsna: IIM will want a business management angle to the event if they are to give it free
    17:37:59 on < jace> ramkrsna: yeah, WIC
    17:38:05 on < jace> rmz102: venue != scheduling
    17:38:07 on <@Khmar> We'll need someplace that can shield people from the heat actually.
    17:38:20 on < jace> unconferences are un-scheduled, not un-located.
    17:38:20 on < techno_freak> september is heat?
    17:38:28 on <@ramkrsna> rain
    17:38:31 on < lut4rp> shouldn't be that hot down south?
    17:38:35 on < techno_freak> bloody rain here
    17:39:00 on <@Khmar> heat/rain. I meant weather.
    17:39:11 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    17:39:21 on <@Khmar> I think we need to discuss more to get at money figures.
    17:39:21 on < techno_freak> we need to look at other things, commute, connectivity, etc.
    17:39:31 on <@Khmar> NExt meeting is probably mostly money discusssions. Thats good.
    17:39:33 on <@ramkrsna> I guess we'll take another discussion on venues in bangalore + sponsorship in the next session
    17:39:34 on < techno_freak> you can't really arrive at money
    17:39:37 on <@Khmar> Shall we reture?
    17:39:38 on <@ramkrsna> how about thrusday
    17:39:41 on <@ramkrsna> ?
    17:39:45 on <@Khmar> The day after?
    17:39:49 on <@Khmar> We'll propose it on the list.
    17:39:55 on < jace> connectivity will improve the more we wait
    17:39:56 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, thursday on what? we need to focus on topics from now onwards
    17:40:03 on < baijum2> Thursday is fine for me
    17:40:04 on <@ramkrsna> everything goes on the list
    17:40:05 on < jace> already gprs is getting up to broadband speeds consistently
    17:40:11 on <@Khmar> Okay.
    17:40:13 on <@Khmar> So it's settled then.
    17:40:21 on <@Khmar> We'll stop the discussion now.
    17:40:25 on < techno_freak> Thursday 8.30 PM
    17:40:26 on <@Khmar> I'll send the summary.
    17:40:29 on < jace> Khmar: +1
    17:40:34 on < rmz102> can we have a discussion on the choices arrived on the list
    17:40:37 on < lut4rp> which list are we talking about here?
    17:40:40 on < rmz102> and then take it up
    17:40:41 on <@Khmar> techno_freak: I'll propose that. If everyone's fine, we can go ahead.
    17:40:49 on <@Khmar> lut4rp: The bangalore python user group list
    17:40:58 on <@ramkrsna> techno_freak, "venue" " rough estimation of the costs", "potential sponsors"
    17:40:59 on < rmz102> guys leaving now
