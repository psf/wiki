In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire [JeffreyRush](JeffreyRush) for full-time work on [Advocacy](Advocacy). The contract was renewed for another six months starting March 15, 2007, along with a [list of tasks to tackle](http://www.python.org/psf/grants/advocacy/revised-tasks.pdf).

Current Tasks:

- Produce more \"5-Minutes with Python\" screencasts \-- I\'ve produced nine screencasts so far (not all 5-min though).
  - Python, Numbers and Array Processing
  - Python and Strings
  - Python and the Imaging Library
  - Python and Relational Databases
  - Python and Object Databases
  - Python and Scientific Computing

- Work on \"Starting and Running a Successful Python User Group\" paper, with select members of the Usergroup Support Committee who have volunteered to help.

- Hold another online meeting of the Usergroup Support Committee.

- Use the [www.python.org mockup area](http://www.dfwpython.org:8000/) to test some proposed changes, re a \"spotlight\" topic and a \"get involved\" feature, and get feedback from the community.

- Decide how to create a \"spotlight\" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.

- Decide how to create a \"get involved\" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.

Existing Challenges (most recent at top):

- crunching a talk down into only 5-minutes - it is surprisingly difficult
- figuring out why threads I start re advocacy and usergroups die out, lacking persistence.
- why no response pretty much at all to the repeated calls for podcasts and screencasts \-- why is the community so averse to multimedia?
