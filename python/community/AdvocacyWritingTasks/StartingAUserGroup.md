# Starting and Running a Successful Python User Group

::: 
Abstract

Discuss the resources available to user groups, such as mailing lists hosts, free wikis and blogs. Mention that user groups can be listed on www.python.org, with python.meetup.com and also Craig\'s list. Discuss how to reach out and find people, advise patience for growth, and suggest various group activities. When you can\'t find a speaker, suggest other activities that can be done on a spur of the moment.

With a few new local Python user groups getting off the ground, it\'s worth reminding ourselves that o\'Reilly offer good support to groups who register with them.

Full details are at [http://ug.oreilly.com](http://ug.oreilly.com). You have to register your group (not too onerous) and in return you can get

> - review copies of o\'Reilly books
> - discounts on o\'Reilly products, a nice benefit for members
> - donations of books, like we were given for the draw at PyCon UK

and, no doubt, a few other things, like I think it\'s possible to get o\'Reilly authors to speak at meetings.
