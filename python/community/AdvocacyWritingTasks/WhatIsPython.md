# Outline for: \"What is Python\"

::: 
Abstract

The goal of this paper is to present a concise, benefits-based explanation of what the Python language is all about, to a reader who is already a programmer but not knowledgeable about Python.

For handing out at mixed-topic conferences and user group meetings, where contact with curious people can be made, to make them aware that Python even exists. In this environment we can\'t be sure of their background but if they are interested in a programming language, we can assume either a basic programming background or team/managerial responsibility.

Include names/logos of your more mainstream companies that are using Python, but probably omit the more obscure ones.
