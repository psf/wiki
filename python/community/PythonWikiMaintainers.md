## Are you a Python Wiki Maintainer? 

If you contribute to the Python Wiki you are! This page is for discussing administration of the Python Wiki. If you want to scurry around and help keep the Wiki well structured and clean up any problems that arise or have any questions about those topics, this is the place.

::: tip
Don\'t forget the [editing guidelines](../people/WikiGuidelines) for the Wiki!
:::

Of course, you don\'t have to be an \"administrator\" to leave a comment here, but you do need to be added to the list of those with edit rights (after years of fighting wiki-spam, this became necessary - see the [WikiGuidelines](../people/WikiGuidelines) for notes on that).
