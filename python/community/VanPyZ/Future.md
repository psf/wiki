# VanPyZ futures talks 

- Henry Precheur:
  - [WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)](http://wsgi.org/wsgi/): WSGI powers all modern Python web frameworks. It provides a unified way to talk HTTP. (Talk can be 30 mins to 1h30 long.)

  - [SQLAchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/): The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python.

- Dethe Elza [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.org/)

- Doug Latornell:
  - I\'ve been looking at [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) for a potential project at work. I haven\'t delved too deeply yet, but if the project gets the go-ahead, I should be able to talk about CouchDB in, say, January, or February. This one would likely be about 30 minutes too, but it depends how much I know when I do it, and how many questions people have.
