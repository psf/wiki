# Python Advocacy Kit for Research Labs 

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit. Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

*Suppose you\'re a scientist or engineer in a research lab and you\'d like to adopt Python in your modeling, analysis or visualization work. What materials would you need to make that happen?*

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a \"[What is Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython)\" flyer

- a \"What is Python\" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group

- a \"What is Python\" podcast for sharing with those who aren\'t convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)

- \"[Scientific Computing with Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ScientificPython)\" whitepaper

- \"[Replacing Matlab with Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ReplaceMatlabWithPython)\" whitepaper

- a whitepaper to share with your peers or a curriculum review board explaining why Python is relevant in today\'s research lab environment.

- \"[Data Visualization and Graphing with Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#DataVisualizationWithPython)\" whitepaper

- a 2-sided flyer of Python resources, listing summary availability of user groups, books, trainers and speakers.

- \"[Using Python with Java](AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithJava) whitepaper

- \"[Python for C++ Programmers](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonForCppProgrammers)\" whitepaper

- \"[Using Python with .NET](AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithDotNet)\" whitepaper

- \"[Python and Databases](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonAndDatabases)\" whitepaper

- \"[Comparing Python to Java](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToJava)\" whitepaper

- \"[Comparing Python to Ruby](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToRuby)\" whitepaper

- \"[This Python is No Tortoise](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonSpeedIssues)\" whitepaper

- \"[Starting a Python User Group](AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup)\" whitepaper, for encouraging one within your facility

- ???

There is quite a mix of whitepapers above because it isn\'t possible to guess which topics the researcher might need. But by providing them all in a kit, the inside advocate can select those appropriate to his research facility.
