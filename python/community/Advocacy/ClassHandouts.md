# Reusable Classroom Handouts 

The idea is to collect links (or attachments) to handouts that can be reused in various classroom scenarios. We would like all content to be licensed under the [GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or [another free license](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#TOC2FreeDocumentationLicenses) so that others can update, expand or rearrange the content. We would also want the media to be one that allows this, such as the original document format. Handouts provided exclusively as PDF files are difficult to update.

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

As far as format, reStructuredText would be nice but at this point anything is welcome. We can convert it for you.
