# Python Advocacy Kit for College Students 

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit. Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

*Suppose you\'re a college student who enjoys programming in Python and you would like to encourage others on your campus to join in. What materials would you need to make that happen?*

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a [campus flyer](AdvocacyWritingTasks#CampusFlyer) advertising user group meetings on campus, single-sided for posting onto bulletin boards

- a \"[What is Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython)\" flyer

- a \"What is Python\" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group

- a \"What is Python\" podcast for sharing with those who aren\'t convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)

- a whitepaper to share with an instructor or university staff explaining why Python is relevant to today\'s education

- \"[How to Start a User Group](AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup)\" whitepaper

- ???
