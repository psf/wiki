# Python Advocacy Kit for IT Departments 

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit. Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

*Suppose you\'re a programmer or perhaps a team leader in an IT group who enjoys programming in Python and you would like to persuade your group to adopt Python. What materials would you need to make that happen?*

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a \"[What is Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython)\" flyer

- a \"What is Python\" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group

- a \"What is Python\" podcast for sharing with those who aren\'t convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)

- a whitepaper to share with a team member or manager explaining why Python is relevant in today\'s development environment.

- a 2-sided flyer of Python resources, listing summary availability of user groups, books, trainers and speakers.

- \"[Using Python with Java](AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithJava)\" whitepaper

- \"[Python for C++ Programmers](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonForCppProgrammers)\" whitepaper

- \"[Using Python with .NET](AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithDotNet)\" whitepaper

- \"[Python: Your Competitive Advantage](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonYourCompetitiveAdvantage)\" whitepaper

- \"[Python and Databases](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonAndDatabases)\" whitepaper

- \"[Scientific Computing with Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ScientificPython)\" whitepaper

- \"[Data Visualization and Graphing with Python](AdvocacyWritingTasks#DataVisualizationWithPython)\" whitepaper

- \"[Cool Python Features](AdvocacyWritingTasks#CoolPythonFeatures)\" whitepaper

- \"[Comparing Python to Java](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToJava)\" whitepaper

- \"[Comparing Python to Ruby](AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToRuby)\" whitepaper

- \"[This Python is No Tortoise](AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonSpeedIssues)\" whitepaper

- ???

There is quite a mix of whitepapers above because it isn\'t possible to guess which tools the business uses and in which industry it operates. But by providing them all in a kit, the inside advocate can select those appropriate to his company.
