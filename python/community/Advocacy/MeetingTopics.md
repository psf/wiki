# Library of Meeting Topics

A collection of meeting topics suitable for reuse by fledgling usergroups who need ideas and kickstart materials for presentations.

More than just a title, the entries should link to talk outlines or actual slide presentations, hopefully with speaker notes so someone else can run with them.

The formats sought, in order of preference, are:

> - [restructured text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) documents and/or [reST/S5 slides](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/slide-shows.html)
> - Openoffice/MS Office documents and slides
> - PDF documents

The goal is to provide modifiable materials under an [open license](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#FreeDocumentationLicenses).
