- **2007/05/14** Created a [blog to be shared](https://python-groups.blogspot.com/) by the organizers of various usergroups in making announcements and giving meeting reports. Have not yet requested for it to be added to an aggregator nor added to www.python.org.

- **2007/05/14** Issued call to community for updates to [the list of Python trainers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining) and also added an entry to the left menu of www.python.org for \"Training Classes\".

He paid for a year of [https://python.meetup.com/183](https://python.meetup.com/183) and has convened two meetings, the first with 5 people, the second with 8. He has also made contact with the local Plone usergroup and is working to build a Portland leadership before he has to return to Dallas.

- **2007/05/12** 2nd Saturday meeting of the DFW Pythoneers, wherein I presented on D-BUS and showed [how to hook events coming from the Jabber IM client Gajim](https://trac.gajim.org/wiki/GajimDBus). We had a new attendee from the Dallas Personal Robotics Group, which is developing some interest in using Python with robots, as M.I.T. is doing. Fortunately Martin Thomas had brought his [TuxDroid](https://www.tuxisalive.com/), which is controlled with Python and which he had turned into a service on the D-BUS, to be controlled by any application. We didn\'t quite make it to having the [TuxDroid](https://www.tuxisalive.com/) controlled from the Gajim jabber client, both D-BUS participants.

- **2007/05/10** Issued call to Python community for help with 11 answers to Forrester Survey. Some responses received but not much content so will need to research the answers myself, due to short deadline of May 18th..

- **2007/05/09** Received working copies of select chapters of the college textbook \"Understanding Computers\", for reworking for the 12th edition.

- **2007/05/08** Continually collecting [quality video lectures](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy/VideoLectures) for use by fledgling usergroups or others. Oddly there are not that many around it seems. Hopefully the ones from [PyCon](PyCon) 2007, once processed, will help here.

- **2007/05/04** Participated in a teleconference with Forrester Research staff, wherein they reviewed their overall philosophy of how they conduct a survey and what can be done with it afterward. There was also a good question and answer exchange among representatives of the various dynamic languages in the call.

- **2007/05/03** Reviewed the [draft criteria](https://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Draft.xls) and gave [detailed feedback](https://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Feedback.txt) to Forrester Research about the criteria to be used in their survey of dynamic languages. The final survey form now looks like [this](https://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Final.xls). The survey has aggressive completion dates and involves interviews with selection community members, the names of which I am submitting. It also needs four samples of source code for specific problems, as well as essay-style answers, which I am handling myself. I\'ve asked the community for help with the source code samples.

- **2007/04/26** Spent time learning Andrew\'s new scheme for content on www.python.org and created [a section for audiovisual materials](https://www.python.org/doc/av/), to be developed in cooperation with [ShowMeDo](ShowMeDo). The section has not yet been added to the main menu, pending creation/processing of new screencasts.

- **2007/04/25** Convened an online meeting with the [Usergroup Support Committee](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy/UsergroupSupport/Committee), a small group of community members to provide input and take on some of the tasks of strengthening the usergroups of Python. This committee has a private mailing list \<[usergroup-advocacy@python.org](mailto:usergroup-advocacy@python.org)\>. The IM transcript of this meeting is online [here](https://dfwpython.org/uploads/Advocacy/usergroup-committee-minutes-20070425.txt).

- **2007/04/19** Created a mailing list, \<[group-organizers@python.org](mailto:group-organizers@python.org)\>: \"To share knowledge, of what works and doesn\'t work in running a vibrant Python usergroup. We seek members of existing usergroups to share their expertise and those who wish to start a usergroup near them and want help in getting started.\" This list has not yet been publicly announced, pending a blog to go along with it.

Also showed how to use the notification-daemon on D-BUS to pop-up balloon help and a brief touch on the wireless services provided by Avahi (zeroconf/rendevous) on the D-BUS. This talk came about as a result of my [PyCon](PyCon) research into a possible One-Laptop-Per-Child keynote, where that project uses much of this same technology.
