We started of with:

- Interaction with a team lead by **Dr Victor Udoewa** from Google\'s [http://www.webacademy.com/splash/](http://www.webacademy.com/splash/) project who would be \" using the insights in order to create a curriculum on digital literacy\"

- Dr Vicotr Udoewa gave a talk on Digital Literacy and what Google is doing to solve the digital illiteracy at different level.

- He told us that Google is trying to solve the problem at three different levels.

- 1st is Power. for areas where stable power source is not there they are helping to setup up power sources that are mainly renewable sources.

- 2nd is Infrastructure for areas that have stable power they help in setup infrastructure for internet like setting up fibecables etc.

- 3rd is outreach program where they go out to teach them. They help them in becoming digital literate and better use the knowledge that is there available through digital mediums.

- In his talk he showed us a video how digital literacy can be helpful very inspiring link [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE63BYWdqC4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE63BYWdqC4)

- It was a long talk with a lot information on literacy education etc.

- After that there was a feed back session for **Dr Victor Udoewa** teams research.

Next up was some thought\'s shared by fellow pythonista **Vaidik Kapoor** here are his thought\'s in his own words as sent out on mailing list thread:

*I spoke about my recent adventures of trying to make Python slightly more functional. I spoke about two things today: Partial Functions or Currying and Tail Call. So just to remind you of the same, I am sharing some content with you so that you can read it if you want to know more:*

*Partial Functions*

- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying)

- [http://pydanny.com/python-partials-are-fun.html](http://pydanny.com/python-partials-are-fun.html)

*Tail Recursion*

- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)

- [http://oldfashionedsoftware.com/2008/09/27/tail-recursion-basics-in-scala/](http://oldfashionedsoftware.com/2008/09/27/tail-recursion-basics-in-scala/)

*To understand what Functional features Python has to offer other than list comprehensions and the simple map, reduce and filter functions, checkout the functools library:*

- [http://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html)

Guys so if you want to be informed about stuff like this go register @ [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/ncr-python.in](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/ncr-python.in)

Next was Aniket Maithani who is doing a project using Pi board named HASS:

- *Home Automation & Security System \[HASS\] is a full fledged home automation system which will be economically viable for the user to adapt. The cross platform type of the application will enable user to get alerts on the go irrespective of the type of phone/system a user uses. The application would be released under GPL License. \--Taken from the documentation found* @ [http://aniketmaithani.github.io/HASS/](http://aniketmaithani.github.io/HASS/)

He is open to suggestion and discussioin about the project improvement and other ideas related to it. So don\'t hesitate and find him on [https://github.com/aniketmaithani](https://github.com/aniketmaithani) also a member of the mailing list.

Last up was general discussions about the next meetup. Anuvrat Parashar and all the members of Reviews42 team that are part of Ncr-python user group have also proposed Reviews42 as the venue for the next meetup.

And for those interested in cloud technology, systems , HGigh perfomance computing, high performance networks etc. Prof. Andrew Lynn has offered to help out with JNU resources.
