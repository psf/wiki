### Participate

Please take a moment to help us by answering the question, \"How could PyCon make you feel (even) more welcome?\"

Plans are being formed for the following events.

- Prior to the Tutorial Sessions, how to install a proper python development environment and how to avoid common newbie mistakes, e.g., don\'t rely on the default Mac python, how to use virtualenv.
- Newbie Night, to be held Thursday, March 8, 2012, to welcome all newbies of all kinds.

The Welcoming Committee is a sub-committee of the PyCon Organizers group. Anyone who wants to own any part of Welcoming may participate.
