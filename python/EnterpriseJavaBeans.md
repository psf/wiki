# EnterpriseJavaBeans

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
Enterprise [JavaBeans](./JavaBeans.html){.nonexistent} is a large J2EE-related specification which aims to make it easier to develop \"enterprise\" applications in Java by encouraging the use of certain architectural patterns and components. Despite the name, it is somewhat different from the [JavaBeans](./JavaBeans.html){.nonexistent} specification, and the two should not be confused.

See [PythonAndJ2EE](PythonAndJ2EE) for more information.
