# Web Applications in Python {#Web_Applications_in_Python}

Numerous widely-deployed Web applications have been written in Python, some employing technologies found on the [WebFrameworks](WebFrameworks) page, others providing much of the technology themselves (and potentially spawning a new framework later on in their existence). The following lists comprise a non-exhaustive collection of such Web applications.

Note that Internet sites \"powered by Python\" which aren\'t downloadable and redeployable should be listed elsewhere (see [WellKnownPythonPrograms](WellKnownPythonPrograms)) - this page is concerned with applications which can be downloaded, studied, customised, run locally, run on an intranet or on the Internet, or used as the basis for other applications.
