If there\'s enough interest, perhaps [EuroPython](EuroPython) might be a good venue for collaborating on PYxIDEs work. Things like\...

- Work on things which support source code analysis:
  - AST node annotation: see where [analysis](http://www.python.org/pypi/analysis){.http} and [astng](http://www.python.org/pypi/astng){.http} can cooperate.

  - Type propagation: see where [analysis](http://www.python.org/pypi/analysis){.http}, [astng](http://www.python.org/pypi/astng){.http} and [t_types](http://tony.lownds.com/home/index.php?topic=types){.http} can cooperate.
