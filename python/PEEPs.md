# PEEPs

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
PEEP stands for \"Python Environment Enhancement Proposal\". The idea was proposed by [AndrewKuchling](AndrewKuchling) and [BengtRichter](./BengtRichter.html){.nonexistent} on comp.lang.python.

*(A new PEP type, Process, has since been introduced. It seems to coincide with the Environment idea. \-- David Goodger)*

The PEEP process should be similar to that of PEPs, but possibly less formal. The PEP process has proven very useful and it is hoped that PEEPs can follow in similar fashion.
