(Explain different instances, including \"Tiny Python 2.5\" available [here](http://www.mhuffman.com/resource/index.html){.http}. Relate to pertinent pages, including \"Varieties\" and [EmbeddedPython](EmbeddedPython).)

There have been many \"slenderized\" Pythons through the years, including

- [http://www.tinypy.org/](http://www.tinypy.org/){.http} New (as of 04/2008) from-scratch implementation

- [this FTP directory](ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/pc){.ftp} of generations for MS-DOS, OS/2, and so on;(link appears dead)

- [Deeply Embedded Python](http://www.tucs.fi/magazin/output.php?ID=2000.N2.LilDeEmPy){.http} - a project which once attracted considerable interest, but seemingly abandoned some time ago

- Jean-Claude Wippler, Jeff Senn, Brian Lloyd and others have worked on tinyPython. One approach is to exploit \"executable compressor\" [UPX](http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html){.http}: \"This gets python15.dll down to 220K and seems to work for me\";

- \[Explain [Pyco](http://www.pythonapocrypha.com/projects/pyco/){.http} and [PythonD](http://members.lycos.co.uk/bdeck/pythond.htm){.http} \];
