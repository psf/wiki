The [Embedded Python](EmbeddedPython) page has details of Python runtimes which work in embedded environments. To reach 2MB you may need to work on reducing the footprint of such installations even further, however.

The [Python implementations](PythonImplementations) page has details of a range of implementations, some of which emphasise compactness over full compatibility with Python. \-- [PaulBoddie](PaulBoddie) 2011-03-26 23:16:51
