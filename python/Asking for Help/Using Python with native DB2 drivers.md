# Asking for Help/Using Python with native DB2 drivers {#Asking_for_Help.2FUsing_Python_with_native_DB2_drivers}

Has someone tried connecting to DB2 using native driver functionality? Specifically interested in ways to run \"load client from \" from the application server. We are using workarounds today - by calling admin_cmd/ sysproc.db2load procedures after transporting files to the server, but trying to get this to work without so many hacks.
