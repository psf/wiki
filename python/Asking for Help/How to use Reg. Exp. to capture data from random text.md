Hi -

I\'m a Python newbie. I HAVE and WILL CONTINUE to study the usages of regular expressions. But in the meantime, I\'d appreciate any quick help that y\'all can give me.

I\'d like to learn how to capture data points defined by some known marker (\'=\', \':\' or other) from random text. For example, I\'d like to capture \"date\" and \"ip address\" from random text like:

\"bla bla bla, loads of random data date = 03/04/2010 more random text ip address: 128.0.0.1 thanks for your help\"

To clarify, I know the NAME of the value, I know the marker, I want to grab the value.

Thanks much for your help.
