# Python for Systems Administration {#Python_for_Systems_Administration}

Python is used in numerous places for systems management and administration:

- Many GNU/Linux distributions use Python to manage resources and packages:
  - In many programs and components in the Ubuntu distributions (and related services): \"Ubuntu prefer the community to contribute work in Python.\" ([Ubuntu bounties for Python work](http://www.ubuntu.com/community/developerzone/bounties){.http})

  - [Reconstructor](http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1){.http} for Ubuntu and [Revisor](http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/){.http} for Fedora - applications which let users customise their GNU/Linux distribution CDs - are both written in Python

  - Red Hat\'s up2date tool (the pulsating red dot)

  - [yum](http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/){.http} provides software updates for Fedora and other distributions

  - [mock](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock){.http} and [plague](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Plague){.http} controls the building of the packages in the Fedora operating system

  - Fedora and Red Hat\'s installer, [Anaconda](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda){.http} (notice the clever python tie-in on the name).

  - Gentoo Linux *relies* on Python since the [Portage](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/){.http} package management system is written in Python

  - Pardus uses Python extensively: [\"Python in Pardus\"](http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/comar/PythonInPardus.html){.http}
- HP Compaq / IBM preinstalled Python on a series of computers for some administration tasks
