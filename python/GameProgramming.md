# Game Programming With Python {#Game_Programming_With_Python}

You can write whole games in Python using [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/){.http}. See a list of other [PythonGameLibraries](PythonGameLibraries) maintained in this Wiki, or [this list maintained on DevMaster.net](http://www.devmaster.net/engines/list.php?fid=6&sid=11){.http}. A full tutorial can be found in the free book [\"Making Games with Python & Pygame\"](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame){.http}.

If you have an existing game and want to add a scripting engine to make it more flexible, Python is also a very good choice. But you\'ll have to learn about [IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages](IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages).

## Websites {#Websites}

[Pygame - The Full Tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/){.https} - A complete pygame tutorial that teaches it from the ground up. Several game projects are also available with step by step explanations and the source.

[Humongous Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20121021155936/http://onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2002/07/11/pythonnews.html){.https} for a 2002 case study on Pygame.

[Pygame RPG Series](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-rpg-game-tutorial/){.https} - A series of short tutorials over the course of which a complete RPG styled game is created using Pygame.

[Pygame programming tutorials](https://pygametutorials.wikidot.com/){.https} is a compilation of a few short tutorials for Pygame.

[Game development with Pygame](https://pythonspot.com/game-development-with-pygame/){.https} is a tutorial that is an introduction to Pygame. Also contains tutorials on how to make several basic games in Pygame.

If you\'re interested in learning how to use Pygame to create 3D games, two sites that are dedicated to 3D Python are [Python 3D(py3d.org)](http://www.py3d.org/){.http} and [Python 3D Software](http://www.vrplumber.com/py3d.py){.http}. You can find several 3D game projects available here.

[PyWeek](http://www.pyweek.org/){.http} is a bi-annual programming challenge site that produces several great games.

## Books {#Books}

There\'s also some books that specifically cover game programming in Python:

[http://inventwithpython.com](http://inventwithpython.com/){.http}

- [\"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python\"](http://inventwithpython.com/){.http} is a free, Creative Commons-licensed book on Python for complete beginners with no experience programming. Each chapter has the source code for a small game such as Tic Tac toe, Hangman, Reversi, and others. The final chapters provide an introduction to Pygame.

[http://inventwithpython.com/pygame](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame){.http}

- [\"Making Games with Python & Pygame\"](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame){.http} is also a free, Creative Commons-licensed book that assumes a small amount of Python programming experience. It goes into more detail with the Pygame library. There is the source code for games such as Tetris, Connect Four, Simon, Sokoban, and others.

[http://www.handysoftware.com/cpif](http://www.handysoftware.com/cpif){.http}

- \"The author set out to write a book like the one he used to teach himself programming at age 12. \... This book has been successfully used by homeschooling families and public school teachers.\" The library and example code supplied with the book is also available for download.
