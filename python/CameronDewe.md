*Cameron Dewe is (still) learning Python.*

I first heard about the Python Computer Programming Language being used to create robots for editing wikis. Then I enrolled in an Operations Research course to learn about Simulation and Stochastic Modelling and discovered that [SimPy](SimPy), the software I would be using was also written in Python. So I downloaded a copy of Python for Windows and tried it out - very interesting.

Oddly, Python has been the first computer programming language I was formally taught since being taught FORTRAN in the 1980\'s. The rest I picked up by reading the grammer or, worse, the help file. A few things are new, but a lot is strangely familiar.
