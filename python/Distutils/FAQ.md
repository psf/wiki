#### Can you use distutils (i.e., your setup.py file) to \'\'\'un\'\'\'install a given package? {#Can_you_use_distutils_.28i.e..2C_your_setup.py_file.29_to_.27.27.27un.27.27.27install_a_given_package.3F}

Unfortunately, no. There is a [proposal](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/Proposals/UninstallCommand){.http} for this, and this would be a useful feature to have though\... However, the KDE group has written a [wrapper](http://www.simonzone.com/software/pykdeextensions/en/distutils-uninstall.html){.http} for distutils that adds a simple uninstall command.
