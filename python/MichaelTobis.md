My homepage is at [http://geosci.uchicago.edu/\~tobis](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~tobis){.http}

My main intellectual interests are

- how people use information to make decisions
- how people use languages to present and to learn information
- climate change as a broadly encompassing instance of #1 and #2
- geophysics and geophysics modeling to inform #3.

This all seems coherent to me, though to others it sometimes seems like I\'m all over the place.

I am pleased to have discovered Python, which plays a role all four pursuits.

I have met an amazing array of amazing people since becoming involved in the Python community. I consider both the language and the community a beacon of hope in gloomy times.
