# Multimedia & Games

Python is a surprisingly good fit for multimedia work -- games, audio processing, music composition, 3D graphics. PyGame alone has over a thousand open-source projects built on it. This section collects pages about game development, audio and video tools, OpenGL bindings, music software, and related resources.

## Game Development

- [GameProgramming](GameProgramming) -- overview of game development in Python, covering PyGame, scripting engines, and learning resources
- [PythonGameLibraries](PythonGameLibraries) -- catalog of game libraries including PyGame, Pyglet, Panda3D, and many others
- [PyGame](PyGame) -- the popular SDL-based library for writing games in Python
- [GameProgrammingBooks](GameProgrammingBooks) -- books about game programming with Python and PyGame

## Audio and Video

- [Audio](Audio) -- starting point for working with audio in Python, covering playback, synthesis, and processing libraries
- [AudioVideo](AudioVideo) -- Python-based audio/video editors, players, converters, and streaming tools
- [PythonInMusic](PythonInMusic) -- music software written in Python, music programming libraries, and applications with Python scripting support

## Graphics

- [OpenGL](OpenGL) -- notes on using the OpenGL graphics library with Python
- [PyOpenGL](PyOpenGL) -- cross-platform Python bindings for OpenGL, GLU, GLUT, and related APIs

## Other

- [MacPython subpages](MacPython/index) -- macOS-specific Python multimedia content (Audio Hijack Pro integration)
- [ShowMeDo](ShowMeDo) -- historical note about ShowMeDo.com, an early video tutorial site that hosted Python content (now defunct)
