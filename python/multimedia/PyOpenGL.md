PyOpenGL is the cross platform Python binding to OpenGL and related APIs. The binding is created using the SWIG wrapper generator, and is provided under an extremely liberal BSD-style Open-Source license.

PyOpenGL includes support for OpenGL v1.1, GLU, GLUT v3.7, GLE 3, WGL 4, and Togl (Tk OpenGL widget) 1.6. It also includes support for dozens of extensions (where supported in the underlying implementation).

PyOpenGL is interoperable with a large number of external GUI libraries for Python including (Tkinter, wxPython, [FxPy](FxPy), [PyGame](PyGame), and Qt).
