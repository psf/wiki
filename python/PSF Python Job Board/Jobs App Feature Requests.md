# Jobs App Feature Requests {#Jobs_App_Feature_Requests}

Based on the user stories and reviews we\'re collecting on these pages:

- [../Jobs App Reviews](./PSF(20)Python(20)Job(20)Board(2f)Jobs(20)App(20)Reviews.html)

- [../Jobs App User Stories](./PSF(20)Python(20)Job(20)Board(2f)Jobs(20)App(20)User(20)Stories.html)

we are distilling a list of feature requests / ideas on this page and assign them to implementation phases:

## Phase 1: Launching the new Job Board {#Phase_1:_Launching_the_new_Job_Board}

The new job board should have a minimal feature set implemented, since we want to launch as soon as possible. More complex features can be added later on.

- job entry has to be possible for job submitters
- job posting must be reviewable through the review page
- the system should provide basic aid in emailing the job submitters about their postings
- the job listing should be usable enough to provide an overview of the available job postings

## Phase 2: Cleanup and Usability Improvements {#Phase_2:_Cleanup_and_Usability_Improvements}

For this phase, we can add new features that simplify the processes and enhance usability:

- add a possibility to provide a deadline for applications to a job posting; after this date the posting will no longer be displayed

- add contract/permanent/temporary/contract-\>permanent/etc field to job applications.

- Add Salary/Rate field.

- add citizenship/visa requirements field to job applications, possibly also if any sponsorship for the same is available.

- possibly add linguistic requirements field.
