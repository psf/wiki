I\'m [Maarten Brouwers](http://www.murb.nl){.http}, student at the TU/e (Eindhoven University of Technology). My interests are in interaction and audio. For quick prototyping Python is ideal, however default audio capabilities are limiting. At this wiki I\'ve been cleaning up some of the pages related to audio in python.
