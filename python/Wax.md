# Wax Gui Toolkit {#Wax_Gui_Toolkit}

Wax is a GUI toolkit. It sits on top of wxPython, removing some of the low-level aspects of that GUI, and adding some useful abstractions.

The goal is that Wax should be easier to use than [WxPython](WxPython), to be more \"Pythonic\". It\'s far from feature complete but very nice for quick hacks.
