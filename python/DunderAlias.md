## Dunder (Double UNDERscore) Alias {#Dunder_.28Double_UNDERscore.29_Alias}

[Mark Jackson](https://www.mark-jackson.online){.https} was the first to suggest **dunder** as a speech shorthand for double underscores (`__`) in a reply to [a query from Pat Notz](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2002-September/155836.html){.https}. [Ned Batchelder](http://www.nedbatchelder.com/){.http} later [stressed the need for a way of pronouncing](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html){.https} **`__`**:

An awkward thing about programming in Python: there are lots of double underscores. \[snip\] My problem with the double underscore is that it\'s hard to say. How do you pronounce `__init__`? \"underscore underscore init underscore underscore\"? \"under under init under under\"? Just plain \"init\" seems to leave out something important. **I have a solution: double underscore should be pronounced \"dunder\". So `__init__` is \"dunder init dunder\", or just \"dunder init\".**

[Antonio Rodriguez](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607232714/http://an.ton.io/blog){.https} reported [immediate adoption](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html#comment_5782){.https} of the alias.
