# Python Shells {#Python_Shells}

The term \"Python shell\" has a certain amount of ambiguity: for some people it may merely refer to an interactive Python environment with special capabilities (autocompletion, visualisation, and so on); for others it may refer to a replacement command environment for traditional UNIX shells (sh, csh, bash, etc.) where emphasis is placed on interaction with files and programs.
