## Bangalore {#Bangalore}

The poll had around 100 people voting with around 64 percent for Bangalor and 36 for Chennai.

### Pros {#Pros}

- Held it there last year. Twice in the same city rule useful for remote delegates.
  - It also helps to learn from past mistakes and smooth out any rough edges in the second year. Larger volunteer traction can be generated.
- Larger number of small sponsors in Bangalore (is this really true?)
- More convenient climate and location for delegates from the North .
- If held twice in a row, its easier to negotiate contracts with vendors on the basis of repeat business.
- Bangalore weather is nicer and the initial.
- The Poll results are in favour of Bangalore

### Cons {#Cons}

- Accommodation, Auditorium and Food are expensive.

## Chennai {#Chennai}

### Pros {#Pros-1}

- High amount of enthusiasm shown by [ChennaiPy](./ChennaiPy.html){.nonexistent} and some ground work already done.

- Good student participation from Chennai last year.

- Change in [PyCon](PyCon) location would create awareness about Python in Chennai and would be helpful for college students.

- Kausik has met people at the recent Barcamp which indicates enough volunteers for ground work.

### Cons {#Cons-1}

- humid climate
  - Decent climate in September/October.
- Farther away from the North
  - People will be taking flights anyway. If it\'s train, it\'s just a few hours more than Bangalore
