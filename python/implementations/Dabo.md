**Desktop applications**. That\'s what Dabo does. It\'s not ***YAWF*** (yet another web framework). There are plenty of excellent web frameworks out there, so if that\'s what you are looking for, Dabo isn\'t for you. But there are almost no desktop application frameworks out there, and if you want to create applications that run on Windows, OS X or Linux, Dabo is for you!

Dabo is a 3-tier, cross-platform application development framework, written in Python atop the wxPython GUI toolkit. And while Dabo is designed to create database-centric apps, that is not a requirement. Lots of people are using Dabo for the GUI tools to create apps that have no need to connect to a database at all.
