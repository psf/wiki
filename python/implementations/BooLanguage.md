A language for the .NET/Mono runtime with a syntax near identical to Python\'s.

See [Gotchas for Python Users](http://boo.codehaus.org/Gotchas+for+Python+Users) for specific comparisons between boo and CPython.

The main difference is that boo is statically typed with type inference. Syntax-wise it is like Python, but feature-wise it is also similar to C#. It implements many features that have been suggested for [Python3.0](./Python3(2e)0.html), including a \"with\" statement and optional explicit static typing declarations (\"x as int\"). Extra features include anonymous methods`/`{.backtick}closures, custom macros and attributes (similar to [PythonDecorators](PythonDecorators)), and soon, optional case-insensitivity.
