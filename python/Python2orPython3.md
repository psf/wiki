Python 3 is strongly recommended for any new development. As of January 2020, [Python 2 has reached End Of Life status](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/){.https}, meaning it will receive no further updates or bugfixes, including for security issues. Many frameworks and other add on projects are following a similar policy. As such, we can only recommend learning and teaching Python 3.
