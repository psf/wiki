- [DocTest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) \-- lightweight testframework, allows you to embed tests directly in the docstrings, making it easy to combine code examples and test cases in one place. Part of the Python Standard Library.

- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org) \-- alternative to [PyUnit](PyUnit) and with a simpler syntax.

- [nose2](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/) \-- a discovery-based framwork that extends unittest (successor to `nose`{.backtick}).

- [Testify](https://github.com/Yelp/Testify/wiki) \-- Pythonic testing framework compatible with unittest tests.

- [Robot](https://robotframework.org/) \-- Framework for test automation and robotic process automation (not just for Python).

- [Behave](https://pypi.org/project/lettuce/) \-- Framework for Behavior-Driven Development.
