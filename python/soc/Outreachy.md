# Outreachy with Python 

[Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/) is a program to help people from underrepresented communities get involved in free and open source software by providing paid internships and mentoring support. Python will not be participating in 2017-2018 due to lack of mentor and administrator availability.

::: important
**No participation in 2017-2018**

Python will not be participating in 2017-2018 because we don\'t have the necessary mentorship available for this season. If you are a student, please consider the many other excellent organizations participating in Outreachy!
:::

If you are an experienced mentor or experienced program admin interested in participating in Outreachy, please contact [TerriOda](TerriOda) (the [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) org admin for Python) to get more information. Please note that Outreachy requires mentors and program administrators who have some experience \-- if you are new to this process, you should participate in [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) for at least a year or two before considering taking on this volunteer job.
