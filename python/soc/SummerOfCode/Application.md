The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is looking for GSoC students to work on a variety of Python-related projects as well as Python itself. The PSF acts as an \"umbrella organization\" under which many smaller sub-organizations can participate in Google Summer of Code. [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) will have the current list of accepted projects.

Before submitting an application,

- read the [SummerOfCode/Expectations](./SummerOfCode(2f)Expectations.html) to understand what is expected of you if you participate.

- join the [soc2014-general](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2014-general) list.

- contact either a mentor or the list itself to inquire about the suitability of your idea(s).

For the most part, you want to contact mentors via their project mailing lists, which are listed on [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) or talk to them via IRC.

Your goal is to develop your GSoC application in concert with one or more possible mentors, taking their feedback to heart and revising your application accordingly. Applications with no willing mentors will generally not be considered, and mentor opinions are taken very seriously in the review process, so you want to impress them.

While prior open source work isn\'t absolutely required, it helps enormously. Even if you haven\'t worked on anything before this, please engage with the project you\'re proposing to work on and submitting some kind of patch (minor code patch, documentation patch, etc.) showing that you can work through the technical issues necessary to contribute. Applicants that do this will be prioritized over those that don\'t.

Your application should discuss, in some detail, the following points:

- what the project is/proposes to do.
- your proposed week-by-week work plan.
- what source code repository you will work in and how and when you will communicate with your mentor.

Please also include the URL of your blog **in your application**. If you don\'t have one, you will need to get one; weekly blog posts are a requirement for participation.

Finally, we need to know how to contact you! Include both an e-mail address and a phone number in your application.

## tl; dr? 

So, in summary:

- find prospective mentors before writing your application, and write your application with their input.

- join the [soc2014-general](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2014-general) list.

- write a good application with at least three milestones (program start, midterm, and end of program)

- show some evidence of open-source experience, or spend a few days working with the project during the SoC application phase.

- include a blog URL, an e-mail address, and a phone number in your application.
