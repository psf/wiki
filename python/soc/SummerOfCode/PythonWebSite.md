## python.org website, docs, tools 

- Automate postings to the [Python Job Board](http://python.org/community/jobs/).

- Help improve the www.python.org web site production system (pyramid) and write documentation to prepare it for open source release.

- Help move www.python.org towards dynamic content generation techniques. (Note that Fredrik Lundh has already written an application that\'s a front-end for content stored in a wiki.)

- Improve Buildbot for python use and/or in general.
  - Add a SQL backend to store build results
  - Implement per-test-case \"Problem Tracking\"
  - write more status display plugins, both web and IM

- Several [DocumentationTools](DocumentationTools) exist for Python. Choose one and improve it. Choose two and combine their features. Choose four or more and take over the world. The Python documentation world, at least.

- There are a lot of potential [Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/) and [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) projects in the [To Do List](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/dev/todo.html). Some examples (listed in the \"Minimum Requirements\...\" section): Nested inline markup; Python Source Reader; Suitability for Python module documentation.

- Create a source code analysis tool similar to that used to produce reports in [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). Perhaps integrate it with [Trac](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac).
