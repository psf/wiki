There are not very many strict requirements for Google Summer of Code Ideas pages, but there are some things that students often ask us for. This page is intended as a starting template for organizations so you don\'t forget those things.

Warning: In 2014, many orgs got rejected because their ideas pages were offline when google checked. **Make sure your ideas page is hosted somewhere that Google\'s Open Source Programs Office will be able to access when they check!**

# About MyOrg 

Tell the students a bit about your organization. Here\'s some questions you might want to answer:

- What software are you creating?
- Why is it interesting?
- Who uses it?
- What languages is it written in?
- How is it going to change the world?

## Contacting MyOrg 

- **IRC channel**:

- **Mailing list(s)**:

Include any special instructions/info about communicating: e.g. what time zones are your mentors in? do you prefer it if gsoc students introduce themselves first or just dive in? are there any common mistakes students make when making a first impression?

## Getting Started 

Links to setup instructions go here. Some suggested things to answer:

- Where is the link to a setup guide for new developers?
- Are there any unusual libraries/applications that need to be installed first?
- What type of source control do you use? (include links to help and setup guides!)
- What\'s the process for submitting your first bug fix?
- Where should students look to find easy bugs to try out?

## Writing your application 

Links to advice about applications and the application template goes here.

# Project Ideas 

You should usually have a couple of project ideas, ranging in difficulty from beginner to expert. Please do try to have at least one, preferably several beginner tasks: GSoC gets a lot of students with minimal open source experience who feel very discouraged (and sometimes even complain to google) if orgs don\'t any have projects at their level.

## 1. Project name 

- **Project description**: Make sure you have a high-level description that any student can understand, as well as deeper details

- **Skills**: programming languages? specific domain knowledge?

- **Difficulty level**: Easy/Intermediate/Hard classification (students ask for this info frequently to help them narrow down their choices. Difficulty levels are something google wants to see, so they aren\'t optional; make your best guess.)

- **Related Readings/Links**: was there a mailing list discussion about this topic? standards you want the students to read first? bugs/feature requests?

- **Potential mentors**: A list of mentors likely to be involved with this project, so students know who to look for on IRC/mailing lists if they have questions. (If you\'ve had trouble with students overwhelming specific mentors, feel free to re-iterate here if students should contact the mailing list to reach all mentors.)

## 2. Project name 

- As above. etc. Unless there\'s a compelling reason to sort in some other order, ideas should be ordered approximately from easiest to hardest.
