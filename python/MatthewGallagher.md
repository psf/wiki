I am a student of [JeffreyElkner](JeffreyElkner) and a Linux (and Python) enthusiast. I\'ve been interested in programming since I was exposed to LOGO in 2nd grade. Python is my favorite language because the syntax doesn\'t get in the way. It\'s also very to read.

I\'m currently working on [GASP(Graphical API for Students of Python)](https://launchpad.net/gasp){.https}
