### Sponsors

Shouldn\'t be necessary, since we\'re trying to go without a budget. However, if any sponsors do appear, there are some things they could do for us:

> - Buying lunch or snacks
> - Swag or door prizes
> - Paying for a locale (if all else fails)
> - a Kinko\'s (or whatnot) card for our program guides / handouts
> - Paying for an after-party

So far, the following sponsors have (contacted us out of the blue and) volunteered to provide goodies:

[Apress](http://apress.com/){.http .reference .external} will send books and swag

[Python Magazine](http://pythonmagazine.com/){.http .reference .external} will send magazines and run an online ad

[WearPython](http://www.wearpython.com/){.http .reference .external} will send swag

Thanks very much!
