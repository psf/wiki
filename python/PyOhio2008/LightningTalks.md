# Lightning Talks {#Lightning_Talks}

A lightning talk is a short presentation of your choosing, no longer than five minutes. There is no approval process to give a lightning talk; speakers simply sign up here or at [PyOhio](PyOhio). The idea is borrowed from [PyCon](PyCon), where they are enormously popular.

[PyOhio](PyOhio) will have one session of lightning talks, delivered one after another as fast as we can connect speakers to the projector. The fast pace makes for a stimulating and exciting session.

Anybody can give a lightning talk. You can give a lightning talk on the same topic you present a poster on or convene an Open Space session on; in fact, that can make a very effective combination.

To reserve a Lightning Talks slot, just edit this page (look for the word-balloon icon at the upper right) and add your name and topic.
