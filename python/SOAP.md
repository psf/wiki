::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
As Wikipedia notes, \"[\... SOAP \... is a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages \...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP){.http}\" It\'s nominally language-independent (and platform-independent, encoding-aware, transport-neutral, \...).

Many Pythoneers are \... reserved about the complexities of and incoherent design of SOAP; Rob Riggs rants for many when he writes \"[\... they invented SOAP for brainwashing software architects.](http://lists.community.tummy.com/pipermail/frpythoneers/2007-April/001352.html){.http}\"
