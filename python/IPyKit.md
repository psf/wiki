\"It\'s basically a [Py2Exe](Py2Exe)\'d \'preconfigured\' [IPython](IPython).\"

It builds in [PyReadline](./PyReadline.html){.nonexistent}. It\'s currently only available for Windows.

Interestingly, the name was invented entirely independently of [Tclkit](http://wiki.tcl.tk/tclkit){.http}, despite their functional similarities.
