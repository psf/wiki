Python Editors / Python IDEs

There are many IDEs and Editors available for Python.

Please see the links below:

[http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments){.http}

[http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors){.http}

Most of your questions would be solved if you go through this list. As a general observation, editors/IDEs happen to be a topic of personal choice\...so you\'d get multiple answers with multiple opinions if you ask on any Python mailing list.

If you are new to Python or are looking for an IDE/Editor to try\...you are encouraged to go through the above links, before asking about it on the [BangPyper](./BangPyper.html){.nonexistent}\'s list.

Some of the Python Editors which featured discussion at [BangPypers](BangPypers):
