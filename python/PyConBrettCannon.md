I plan on making sure that enough detail is covered so that anyone attending the tutorial will be able to read the [python-dev Summaries](http://www.python.org/dev/summary/){.http} with no problems in regards to the [reST](http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html){.http} syntax.

The slides (in some form or another) can be found at [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/\~bac/rest_tutorial.html](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bac/rest_tutorial.html){.http}
