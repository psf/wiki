# Guides and How-Tos

A collection of practical guides written by community members over the years. These cover specific tasks -- packaging, exception handling, building executables, working with Tkinter -- rather than teaching Python from scratch. Some pages are well-maintained; others are historical artifacts from the MoinMoin wiki era. Check dates and versions before following any advice here too literally.

## General How-To Collections

- [How to...](How to.../index) -- an index of various "how to" pages covering common Python tasks
- [HowTo](HowTo/index) -- another collected set of how-to guides and recipes
- [How to...](How to...) -- single-page quick reference for assorted Python tasks
- [HowTo](HowTo) -- landing page for how-to articles

## Getting Help

- [Asking for Help](Asking for Help/index) -- advice on how to ask good Python questions and where to ask them
- [How to start learning Python?](How to start learning Python_ Any suggestions) -- community suggestions for new learners looking for direction

## Specific Tasks

- [Handling Exceptions](HandlingExceptions) -- patterns and practices for exception handling in Python
- [How to Edit Python Code](HowToEditPythonCode) -- history and overview of editors and IDEs for Python
- [How to Make exe on Windows](How to make exe on Windows) -- building standalone Windows executables from Python scripts
- [How to Publish Python Modules](How to publish Python modules) -- getting your code onto PyPI (redirects to current packaging docs)
- [How to Use gzip with pickle](How to I use gzip module with pickle_) -- compressing pickled data using the gzip module
- [Mutable Buffers in Python 2.3](How to have a mutable buffer with python 2.3_) -- working with mutable byte buffers in older Python

## Tkinter and Tcl

- [How Tkinter Can Exploit Tcl](How Tkinter can exploit Tcl/index) -- using Tcl features and extensions from within Tkinter

## Code Snippets

- [Powerful Python One-Liners](Powerful Python One-Liners/index) -- collected one-liners with explanations
- [Powerful Python One-Liners](Powerful Python One-Liners) -- single-page version of the one-liner collection

## C/C++ Integration

- [Boost.Python](boost.python/index) -- using Boost.Python to wrap C++ code for use in Python
