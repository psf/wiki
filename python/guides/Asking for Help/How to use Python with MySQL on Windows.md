# Asking for Help: How to use Python with MySQL on Windows 

This is all for MS Windows.

Prereq: - Python (2.4.2 in my case) - Install MySQL (5 in my case) - Check that it works fine

Next steps I then install MySQLdb (version 1.2)

When running the installer on Win XP I get - message that Python v2.3 could not be found in registry.

I\'ve tried this on a few PC \-- all the same.

Any ideas? no
