PyConDC2004 is over. The Docutils BoF session saw about 20 people attending. I described the results of the sprint, then opened the floor for discussion. Got some good ideas. I\'ll post a summary here shortly.

See [A Week at PyCon DC 2004](http://starship.python.net/~goodger/pycon_dc_2004/){.http} for a narrative account of events.

For posterity\'s sake, here\'s the original text:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Docutils Birds-of-a-Feather session will be a chance to talk about Docutils, and put faces to names. It\'s tentatively scheduled for 8pm on Wednesday March 24 (see [PyConBofs](./PyConBofs.html){.nonexistent}). Contact: [David Goodger](mailto:goodger@python.org){.mailto}.

Topics? Anything goes. We could have a report on the [DocutilsSprint](DocutilsSprint). Add further topics here.
