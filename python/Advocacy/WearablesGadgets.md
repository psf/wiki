*Having cool merchandise is one way to spread the word about Python. We all love a T-shirt with a good idea on it. And a carefully understanded polo shirt works well too. But what else might work?*

While the [PSF](PSF) may offer some of these items, the goal is not necessarily to raise funds but to promote the adoption of Python. We prefer items that cast Python in a favorable light over those that are just cute.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## T-Shirt Slogans/Graphics {#T-Shirt_Slogans.2FGraphics}

- ???

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Polo Shirt Logos {#Polo_Shirt_Logos}

- \"Python\" + Python Logo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coffee Mugs {#Coffee_Mugs}

- ???

A travel mug would be good; I\'d buy one. \--[FredDrake](FredDrake)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Posters {#Posters}

- [The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/doc/Humor.html#zen){.http}

- ???

And what size of poster would you want? Is 11\"x14\" good enough? The *right* size is probably dependent on the content. An 11\"x14\" Zen of Python poster is probably good for cubicle art.

## Buttons/Stickers {#Buttons.2FStickers}

- The PSF\'s [CafePress](./CafePress.html){.nonexistent} store has bumper stickers and oval stickers with the Python logo. We can purchase them at-cost for resale, though it might be possible to find a cheaper vendor for bulk purchases.

- Those metal pins that [PyCon](PyCon) has are really, really nice. Something like that with the Python logo would be cool.

## Necklaces and USB Key {#Necklaces_and_USB_Key}

- With an embed Python running from a simple clic (we have such a project at afpy in france)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plastic snakes (with a logo?) {#Plastic_snakes_.28with_a_logo.3F.29}

- A little plastic snake - many dev\'s have toys at their desks. Maybe even a movie (Indiana Jones?) tie in (though I guess there are copyright/trademark issues with that??)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mousepads {#Mousepads}

\* 2 years ago many people were interested in this as [PyCon](PyCon) swag
