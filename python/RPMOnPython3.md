## \[\[SummerOfCode/2011\]\] Project Idea {#A.5B.5BSummerOfCode.2F2011.5D.5D_Project_Idea}

The Python bindings to the RPM library currently support Python 2 only. Dave Malcolm did a rough port to Python 3, which currently leaves out proper string processing. The objective of this project is to do a proper port.
