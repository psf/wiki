# buildout

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
**[Buildout](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout){.http}** is a \"system for managing development buildouts\".

While often identified as a [Zope](Zope) project, and indeed licensed under the [ZPL](./ZPL.html){.nonexistent} by Zope creator [Jim Fulton](./Jim(20)Fulton.html){.nonexistent}, **buildout** is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases, a few that have nothing to do with [Python](Python). The home page includes extensive documentation, examples, and more.

At one level, buildout (still referred to as \"zc.buildout\" on occasion) manages [egg](egg)s.

\[explain relation to easy_install and eggs; **workingenv.py** and **virtualenv.py**; explain usage\]

Other treatments of **buildout** include:

- [Martin Aspelli](./Martin(20)Aspelli.html){.nonexistent}\'s book on [Plone](Plone) 3, which includes a good reference on **buildout**;

- the Zope 3 Wiki includes a [useful page](http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/UsingBuildout){.http} on the subject;

- Jim wrote a [tutorial](http://grok.zope.org/minitutorials/buildout.html){.http};

- [Tutorial class for PyCon 2008](./buildout(2f)pycon2008(20)tutorial.html)

A proposal is being floated to create a more professional site for buildout. At a first step, let\'s [collect notes](./buildout(2f)newsite(20)notes.html) on what such a site would contain.
