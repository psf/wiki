# BeginnersWorkshop

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
The Beginning Programmers Workshop will be held as a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session at [Ohio LinuxFest 2008](http://ohiolinux.org/){.http}. Hopefully it will inspire similar workshops elsewhere.

The idea is simply to bring new programmers, and programmers new to Python, together with experienced ones to take their first steps in Python in an environment with plenty of help to get them over the hump.
