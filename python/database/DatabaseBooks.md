**An Introduction to Database Systems** C.J. Date ISBN: [0201385902](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201385902 "ISBN")

A textbook explaining the relational model in great detail, and written by a well-known relational database commentator. New editions of this book are regularly released every two or three years, so the ISBN might be out of date; the ISBN is for the seventh edition, but you should check if there\'s a newer one. (On the other hand, old editions are still perfectly readable and useful, and likely can be found much more cheaply.)

**Database Management Systems** Raghu Ramakrishnan and Johannes Gehrke ISBN: [0072465638](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0072465638 "ISBN") [McGraw](./McGraw.html)-Hill

A textbook on database concepts (relational algebra, entity-relationship modelling), programming (SQL), implementation (files, indices, hashes, query optimization, transactions), and \"advanced concepts\" (distributed databases, data mining, object-databases). This book is an alternative to Date\'s book.

**The Data Access Handbook: Achieving Optimal Database Application Performance and Scalability** John Goodson and Robert A. Steward

ISBN: 0137143931 Prentice Hall, March 2009.
