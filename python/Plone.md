There\'s a lot to tell about Plone.

\"Plone is a ready-to-run [content management system](./content(20)management(20)system.html) that is built on the powerful and free [Zope](Zope) [application server](./application(20)server.html){.nonexistent}.\" So says the \"[What is Plone?](http://plone.org/about/plone/){.http}\" page of the [Plone Web site](http://plone.org){.http}. Wikipedia also [has plenty to say](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone_(content_management_system)){.http}.

\[Explain what this means.\]

Plone.org maintains Wikis, but apparently only to process fault Tickets, that is, as a \"[bug and feature tracker](http://dev.plone.org/plone/wiki/){.http}\". There\'s nothing directly comparable to the Python Wiki.

A [PloneSprint](PloneSprint) is frequently scheduled\--half-a-dozen times annually? There are local user group meetings, annual conferences, \...

Plone is particularly prominent in Latin America, Europe, \...

Plone progress is managed in terms of [PLIP](http://plone.org/documentation/glossary/plip){.http}s and [roadmap](http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap){.http}s.
