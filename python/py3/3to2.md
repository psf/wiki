3to2 is a project to convert cleaner 3.x code to 2.x.

3to2 started as a project idea to reuse the 2to3/lib2to3 codebase for converting 3.x code to 2.x. This creates a new package, \'refactor\', which supports lib2to3 and (non-existent) lib3to2.

The following goals were targeted at the US [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) 2009 sprint of Python Core:

- retain lib2to3 API since it is in use (perhaps deprecate it later)
- build a base package \'refactor\' and port lib2to3 to it
- package refactor with a 3to2 script
- tackle high-priority conversions

The discussions at the sprint pointed to a handful of essential conversions to use as starting goals of 3to2:

- from `__future__ import *`{.backtick} (2.6)

- convert str or bytes to `u''`{.backtick} or `b''`{.backtick}, respectively

- convert `print`{.backtick} functions (2.5 and earlier)

- convert exceptions (2.5 and earlier)

How far back into 2.x should 3to2 go?

Conversions from 3.x to 2.4 and earlier have a lot more work to do than those of 3.x to 2.6 and later. `:-)`{.backtick} During the sprint, we approached tackling major conversion items (see short list above) for 3.x to 2.6, then 2.5, then 2.4, \...

During the Google Summer of Code 2009, [Joe Amenta](JoeAmenta) wrote a more-or-less complete lib3to2. It is hosted on [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/amentajo/lib3to2) and has a [PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2).
