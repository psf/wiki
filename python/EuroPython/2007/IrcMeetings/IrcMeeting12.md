## Time/Location {#Time.2FLocation}

The meeting will take place on Monday 28th May (2007-05-28) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. *That\'s 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.* The suggested duration of the meeting is at most *one hour*.

## Minutes {#Minutes}

- Bea discussed the idea of inviting people to enhance the open space experience at the conference, as suggested [in a message to the europython mailing list](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-May/006403.html){.http}.

  - The response was generally positive, so she will pursue one contact to make a proposal in order to get PSF funding for travel and accommodation costs. The program chairs will deal with this.
  - Bea and others will look around for other likely candidates for this purpose. Bea suggested Jim Hugunin, David suggested Brett Cannon and the Jython people, Paul suggested some GNOME people.

- David clarified the situation regarding Simon Willison\'s accommodation, and Michael sent a reminder to Guido to make sure he has somewhere to stay. Laura will receive the reimbursement claims.

- We looked at the talk situation and felt that some areas/themes were underrepresented. The programme will be finalised a little later than planned while some of the organisers finish other work. We can try to get a partial programme released for the original deadline.

- The [WorldPay](./WorldPay.html){.nonexistent} application process is still ongoing.

- Sponsorship options were discussed:
  - Paul mailed Laura and Dario about sponsorship proposals that need to be processed.

- Next week\'s meeting will focus on the programme, but may also cover any other issues that arise. Information about any meetings that take place will be posted to [the mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython){.http}.
