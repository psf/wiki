# 2010 {#A2010}

Tuesday June 1st, 2010 at 7PM

[Andy McKay](http://twitter.com/andymckay){.http}: Using SMS in the Developing World

RapidSMS is an open source project for messaging, data collection and co-ordination over SMS. It's used throughout the world for a variety of projects, from fighting child malnutrition and malaria to monitoring elections.

This talk introduces RapidSMS and shows what the library can do. We then cover some of the projects that use it including monitoring children in Malawi and diagnosing children in Kenya. The samples show how the project is used in the real world to make a real difference to people.

This is a talk Andy\'s going to be [giving at OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13890){.http}.

### First looks at Google App Engine {#First_looks_at_Google_App_Engine}

Paul Prescod: May 6, 2008

Google App Engine is Google\'s attempt to make cloud computing a reality. With App Engine, developers can upload Python Web applications and have them run on Google infrastructure. \"For free\" you get code and data replication, failover and nearly infinite scalability (given that you adhere to certain programming rules). On the other hand, the current release of App Engine is very limited in its functionality and quotas and long-term features/pricing are unknown. At this talk we\'ll drill down and discuss what\'s right with App Engine, what\'s wrong with it and how it is likely to evolve.

Brett Cannon: September 4, 2007

Under development in the mind of Guido for years, Python 3.0 is finally becoming a reality with a planned alpha in August. While great strides are being taken to not change the feel of the language, Python 3.0 does break backwards-compatibility and introduce many new features to the language (while removing other features to make room for the new one). This talk will be a basic overview of what Python 3.0 is trying to accomplish and how it is accomplishing it.

Brett is working towards his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of British Columbia while being one of the core developers of Python.

### Stock trading with Python {#Stock_trading_with_Python}

April 3, 2007

An Automated Trading System (ATS) is used to find profitable trading strategies and electronically execute these strategies across in realtime.

We examine how the ATS retrieves data using TCP/IP sockets and stores large datasets in a HDF5 database. The trading platform uses this data to backtest trading strategies and manage executions across hundreds of stocks. Finally, we review how electronic stock trades can be made using a broker API\... all using Python.

### Desperately Seeking Abstraction {#Desperately_Seeking_Abstraction}

Mishtu Banerjee: Tuesday October 4th

- "I built an SQL query generator (as part of a larger project) based on the underlying abstraction of representing data models as \"networks\". It\'s a nice illustration of abstracting a particular analysis pattern (in this case, we're abstracting the pattern of multi-table inner joins, which is one of the most common ad-hoc query types)"
