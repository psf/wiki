### InTheirOwnWords {#InTheirOwnWords}

CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than eight years old and it is has proven very fast and stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the simplest ones to the most demanding ones.

CherryPy does its best to stay out of the way between the programmer and the problem. CherryPy applications are usually very simple. It works out of the box; default behavior is sensible enough to allow use without extensive setup or customization. The embedded web server allows one to deploy web applications anywhere Python is installed. In short, CherryPy is as pythonic as it gets.

Oh, and most importantly: CherryPy is fun to work with ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)"){height="16" width="16"}
