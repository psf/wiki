Hi,

I signed up to correct some links on the [pycon2008 tutorial](./buildout(2f)pycon2008(20)tutorial.html).

I\'m at the moment (2013) employed at [DBC A/S](http://www.dbc.dk){.http} where I work as a developer. Coding mostly Drupal (PHP) but I am looking into using Python for creating and managing jobs at a Jenkins server to make building and testing easier. Hopefully I will continue to use Python for various purposes such as hacking, testing and pure fun. ![;-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile4.png ";-)"){height="16" width="16"}
