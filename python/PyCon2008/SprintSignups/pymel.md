### Project Info

Pymel makes python scripting in Autodesk\'s Maya work the way it should. By taking advantage of python\'s strengths \-- particularly, a flexible, object-oriented design \-- pymel builds on the default Maya modules by organizing its commands into a class hierarchy, and by customizing them to operate in a more succinct, intuitive, and pythonic way.
