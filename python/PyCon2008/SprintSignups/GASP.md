**Project Info**

GASP, the Graphics API for Students of Python, is a procedural API for beginning programmers. It is built on the PyGame library, which, though full-featured, is too complicated for beginners to easily learn. GASP provides a fun and easy way to write games and other programs using colors, shapes, text, pictures, sounds, and movement.
