One book recommended by [AlexMartelli](AlexMartelli) and others present: *[Practical Python](http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=93){.http}*, by Magnus Lei Hetland

There\'s an education SIG, complete with mailing list: [EduSig](http://python.org/sigs/edu-sig/){.http}

Also useful is the free writing at [pyBiblio](http://ibiblio.org/obp/pyBiblio){.http} (part of iBiblio, formerly [SunSite](./SunSite.html){.nonexistent}).

We could really use some success stories of Python in education.
