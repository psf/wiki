# About {#About}

Python Software Foundation\'s Infrastructure commitee put out a call for trackers (bug/request/issue/ticket trackers) in June 2006 in order to evaluate alternatives to [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470){.http} for use by the Python development team. A copy of that request can be found at [OriginalCallForTrackers](OriginalCallForTrackers).

Jira was the first choice of the committee. A lot of people complained about using a closed-source and hosted bug tracker, so a call was posted for volunteers to help administer a Roundup installation. Enough volunteers came forward, so work is now proceeding on improving the conversion to Roundup.

The Roundup bug tracker that serves [http://bugs.python.org/](http://bugs.python.org/){.http} is actually hosted at [http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/](http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/){.http}

Bugs found in the living installation of Roundup for Python bugs are reported to **meta-tracker** \-- is at [http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/](http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/){.http} Please report problems with the bug tracker there.
