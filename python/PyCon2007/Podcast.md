# No release {#No_release}

We have audio for these talks, but not release forms. I\'ll write the authors and ask if they signed a release, wish to sign one now, or want the raw audio for their own talk.

Topographica (possibly partial) Test Automation for a Complex System Some lightning talks }}}

# Keynotes {#Keynotes}

We have sizable chunks of the GvR, Krstic, and Lefkowitz keynotes; I haven\'t verified whether we actually have every minute of those talks.

There\'s 12 minutes of audio from the Goldberg keynote, but that\'s not enough for us to post.
