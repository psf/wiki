# Cryptography 

Python includes several modules for [hashing](http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-hashlib.html) and even basic [ssl support](http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-socket.html) which is integrated into the socket module.

For more serious cryptography work, have a look at the following extension modules.

## Interfaces to OpenSSL 

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) is an open-source library that implements SSL and comes with a large number of very fast crypto and hash algorithm implementations.

- [M2Crypto](M2Crypto) - Python interface to OpenSSL

- [pyOpenSSL](http://pyopenssl.sf.net/) - Python interface to OpenSSL, with focus on SSL networking

  - [eGenix pyOpenSSL Distribution](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/pyOpenSSL/) - An easy-to-install distribution of pyOpenSSL

## Stand-alone Cryptographic Libraries 

- [Python Cryptography Toolkit](http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html) - A collection of crypto-related algorithms and protocols implemented as Python extension
