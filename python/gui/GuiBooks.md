*wxPython in Action* is the first published book on wxPython, an open source graphical user interface (GUI) framework that allows developers to build cross-platform applications with robust, highly functional graphical user interfaces. Co-authored by wxPython creator and a senior software engineer, *wxPython in Action* is the authoritative book on the subject.

*wxPython in Action* is an easy to use tutorial, a detailed guide to best practices, and an extensive reference for wxPython\'s large widget library. The book\'s direct, no-nonsense style makes for an easy introduction to the concepts. It offers a complete discussion of when, why, and how to use the many widgets in the toolkit and includes dozens of handy reference tables of object properties, methods, and events.

**Python and Tkinter Programming**

- John E. Grayson

ISBN: [1884777813](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1884777813 "ISBN"), Manning Publications, 688 pages (February 2000)

Presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion, with lots and lots of example code. At the moment this is the only guide to Tkinter programming in print, so this is the book to get if you want to learn Tkinter.

Grayson\'s book is a master class in GUI development so it\'s a bit of a steep learning curve, even if you\'ve done GUI programming before. He also uses Python Mega Widgets ( [widgets](http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/widgets.html) ) ) to illustrate how quickly sophisticated applications can be built with Python.
