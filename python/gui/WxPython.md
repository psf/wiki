wxPython is a blending of the [WxWidgets](WxWidgets) (formerly [WxWindows](WxWindows)) class library for C++ and Python. wxPython can be found at (surprise!) [http://www.wxpython.org/](http://www.wxpython.org/) and it has its own wiki there: [http://wiki.wxpython.org/](http://wiki.wxpython.org/). wxPython Guide is a thorough tutorial on wxPython toolkit. It can be found on [zetcode.com](http://www.zetcode.com/wxpython)

A short series on wxPython can be found on [pythonspot.com](https://pythonspot.com/wx/)

[IgorTamara](IgorTamara): WxPython in a [good linux distribution](http://www.debian.org) is really easy to install, just : **apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-python** or

[MythDebunking](MythDebunking): *WxPython is hard to install on Unix. You need the right versions of GTK, [WxWidgets](WxWidgets) and WxPython.*
