## About PyQt 

**The contents of this page should probably be merged with the [PyQt](PyQt) page and this page made to redirect there.**

[PyQt](PyQt) is a set of Python bindings for [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com) that are dual-licensed under the GPL (version 2 and 3, with additional license exceptions) and a commercial license. There is also PySide by Nokia - new alternative bindings (as of November 2009) with LGPL license that struggle to be API compatible (at least until Qt 4.6) with PyQt4.

[PyQt](PyQt) exposes much of the functionality of Qt to Python, including:

- A comprehensive set of [widgets](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtwidgets/qtwidgets-index.html)

- Flexible [layout managers](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtwidgets/qlayout.html)

- Standard [GUI features for applications](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-mainwindow.html) (menus, toolbars, dock windows)

- Easy communication between application components (signals and slots)

- A [unified painting system](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/topics-graphics.html) with transparency, anti-aliasing, OpenGL integration and SVG support

- Internationalization (i18n) support and integration with the [Qt Linguist](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtlinguist/qtlinguist-index.html) translation tool

- [Rich text processing](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtgui/richtext.html), display and printing facilities, including support for PDF export (Qt 4.1 and later)

- Database support (SQL) and model/view features

- [Threading classes](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/threads.html), providing abstractions for threads, mutexes and semaphores

- Integrated resource handling for applications

- Widget styles, including support for [widget stylesheets](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/stylesheet.html) (from Qt 4.2 onwards)

- Input/output and networking
  - Qt 4.3 and later supports Secure Sockets Layer communications

- A powerful, feature-rich [graphics canvas](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/graphicsview.html) (Qt 4.2 and later)

- Inter-process communication for Unix via D-Bus message buses (Qt 4.2 and later)

- Text completion and undo frameworks (Qt 4.2 and later)

- XML handling APIs, including SAX, DOM and (from Qt 4.3 onwards) a stream-oriented API
  - Support for XML query technologies, such as [XQuery, XPath](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qtxmlpatterns.html) and [XSLT](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtxmlpatterns.html#xslt-2-0).

- An [ECMAScript interpreter](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtscript.html) with the ability to access Qt\'s object model

- Support for [Qt Designer](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-designer.html), including facilities to add custom Python-based widgets to the standard set of Qt widgets available to user interface designers.

- [WebKit browser engine integration](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qtwebkit.html).

- Support for [audio and video playback](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/phonon-overview.html).

## Documentation and Learning Materials 

**The PyQt4 tutorial** available at [http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/)

[Comprehensive documentation](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/) is available for PyQt4 which includes detailed [class and function documentation](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html).

The [PyQt Wiki pages](PyQt) aim to provide tutorials and sample code for PyQt4.

An [overview of PyQt4](http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=33&sessionId=41&confId=44) was presented at [EuroPython](EuroPython) 2006.

An introduction to using [PyQt4 with Qt Designer](http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Creating_GUI_Applications_with_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer) for the development of GUI applications was given at [PyCon UK 2007](http://www.pyconuk.org).

The book [Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt](http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html) is PyQt4-specific and covers development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3.

Installation instructions for [PyQt](PyQt) 4.4 on Windows with MinGW is available at [http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/01/how-to-install-pyqt-41-python-25-and-qt_8340/](http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/01/how-to-install-pyqt-41-python-25-and-qt_8340/)

French translation of [PyQt](PyQt) 4 Documentation is available at [http://leroybrice.free.fr/?/Python-Bindings-Tools-For-QtV](http://leroybrice.free.fr/?/Python-Bindings-Tools-For-QtV)
