PyWebkitGtk provides python bindings around [Webkit](http://webkit.org) when it has been compiled for GTK2. PyWebkitGtk requires, and augments, [PyGtk2](./PyGtk2.html). Recent support has been added to [PyWebKitGtk](./PyWebKitGtk.html) to provide full DOM access manipulation, including javascript code execution and evaluation.

PyWebkitGtk comes with a demo application which is practically a fully-featured web browser in its own right. PyWebkitGtk is the basis for [PyjamasDesktop](PyjamasDesktop), which provides a much easier-to-use framework for application development than PyWebkitGtk on its own (it is fair to say that whilst PyWebkitGtk is on the same level as [PyGtk2](./PyGtk2.html), [PyjamasDesktop](PyjamasDesktop) is on the same level as [KiWi](http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi)).
