## Ways of writing applications with PyQt and PyKDE 

- [Development With Eric3](./PyQt(2f)DevelopmentWithEric3.html)

- [ipython](http://ipython.scipy.org/) 0.6.14 and later supports Qt\'s threading model, making it possible to use Qt interactively from within an interactive Python session.

- [Sandbox](http://www.qtrac.eu/sandbox.html) provides facilities for learning and experimenting with Python, and for creating and editing Python files.
