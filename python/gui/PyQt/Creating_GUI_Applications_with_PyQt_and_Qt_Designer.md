# Creating GUI Applications with PyQt and Qt Designer 

This presentation was given as a scheduled talk at PyCon UK 2007. The material presented covered the following subjects:

- Generating code from user interface descriptions with `pyuic4`

- Connecting signals and slots using auto-connection

- Creating custom widgets with [PyQt4](PyQt4) for use in Qt Designer

## Materials 

The following materials are available:

- [Slides](http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/Qt/PyCon_UK_2007_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer.pdf) outlining how to use Qt Designer with PyQt4

- [Example code](http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/Qt/Software/PyCon_UK_2007_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer.zip) used in the talk

## Examples 

Three examples are provided:

**The PyPI Information example shows how a graphical user interface created with Qt Designer can be accessed and used in a PyQt4 application.**

[![\[ATTACH\]](/wiki/europython/img/attach.png "[ATTACH]")]( "Upload new attachment "equationviewer.png"")

**The Equation Viewer example uses a more realistic user interface, with menus, actions and toolbar buttons, and shows how these elements can be connected to features written in Python.**

![logomaker.png](attachments/PyQt(2f)Creating_GUI_Applications_with_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer/logomaker.png "logomaker.png")

**The Logo Maker example contains two custom widgets: the color button is described in the slides, but the logo widget itself can also be used from within Qt Designer.**
