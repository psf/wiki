## PyQt4 Licensing 

PyQt4 is available under two main types of license. In simple terms, you need a PyQt4 license that matches your Qt license.

### GPL (version 2 or 3) 

**Platforms:** Windows, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X\
Your application must be released under a license that is compatible with the GPL.

### Commercial License 

**Platforms:** Windows, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X\
Your application may be released under any license you choose, except pure GPL. If you choose GPL, you must add to license statement special exception clause to permit linking to non-free library, since Qt is not a part of operating system (by the means of [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/)) and is not free by itself.

## Older Licenses 

Earlier versions of PyQt (version 3, for example) were available under a wider range of licenses (described below) which were closely modelled on the licenses used for Qt itself.

### GPL (version 2) 

**Platforms:** UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X\
Your application must be released under a license that is compatible with the GPL.

### Commercial License 

**Platforms:** Windows, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X\
Your application may be released under any license you choose, except pure GPL. If you choose GPL, you must add to license statement special exception clause to permit linking to non-free library, since Qt is not a part of operating system (by the means of [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/)) and is not free by itself (the only free version is for X11 and Mac OS X).

### Evaluation License 

**Platforms:** Windows\
This version of PyQt is to be used with the evaluation version of Qt. You may not release applications using this combination of PyQt and Qt.

### Non-commercial License 

**Platforms:** Windows\
This version of PyQt is to be used with the non-commercial version of Qt based on Qt v2.3.0. Your application must be released under a license that is compatible with the Qt Non-commercial license.

### Educational License 

**Platforms:** Windows\
This version of PyQt is to be used with the educational version of Qt. Note that this is different to the academic version of Qt. Your application must be released under a license that is compatible with the Qt Educational license.

### Unsupported Qt Licenses 

There is no version of PyQt that corresponds to the Qt Academic license. Instead you must use the PyQt Commercial version.

At the request of Trolltech, there is no version of PyQt that corresponds to the non-commercial version of Qt distributed with the book *C++ GUI Programming with Qt3*.
