## PyLog as interface to SWI Prolog {#PyLog_as_interface_to_SWI_Prolog}

Pylog is an interface to SWI Prolog for Python. Originally written by [W. Michael Petullo](http://www.flyn.org/projects/Pylog/index.html){.http}. Gocept company adopted it to work with swipl 0.4 and released as [open source](http://www.gocept.com/angebot/opensource/Pylog){.http}. Also the returned data structures are much better.

Current stable version of [SWI Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/){.http} is 5.2.13. What is 0.4? Gocept site looks updated, however. \-- [MikeRovner](MikeRovner) 2004-02-12 23:28:45

## Discussion {#Discussion}

I was looking for a better way of using Prolog - that is: *How can I use Prolog in the 21st century ?* I think one would need an integration with an *imperative language* so that one can *glue* things together in a simple and natural way; I read some prolog books and when they started about (e.g.) *loops* it quickly got very ugly.\
Secondly it seems to me that I couldn\'t use anything anymore that would be [ObjectOriented](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObjectOriented "Wiki"){.interwiki} that is e.g.:\
If you have one database about one think, how can you combine that with another one with getting into name confict. (I hope someone finds a better example - to make the point that I am thinking of more than just *namespaces*!)\
If someone reads this, please send me an email to `haase`{.backtick} *at* `msg`{.backtick} *dot* `ucsf`{.backtick} *dot* `edu`{.backtick} - Cheers. \-- [SebastianHaase](./SebastianHaase.html){.nonexistent}
