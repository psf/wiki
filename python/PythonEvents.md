The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring around the world or online.

## Event Listings {#Event_Listings}

- For conference and user group events, please see the [PythonEventsCalendar](PythonEventsCalendar) page for details. The calendars are available on the python.org website as:

  - [Python Conferences Events Calendar](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/){.https}

  - [Python User Group Events Calendar](https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/){.https}

  or combined as:

  The calendars are maintained by a group of volunteers. If you want to submit conference and user group events, please see the [submission section](PythonEventsCalendar#Submitting_an_Event) of the project page. In recent years, the events calendars have grown to be a standard resource for people trying to find Python community related events, so we\'d like to encourage your submission to those calendars.

- If you are looking for training events in upcoming months, please see the [PythonTraining/Events](./PythonTraining(2f)Events.html) page.

- [TechVenue.com](http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=Python){.http} has another calendar of Python events that includes regularly scheduled user-group meetings.
