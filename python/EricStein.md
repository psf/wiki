Eric Stein (aka Toba) was a PSF Summer of Code student in 2007 to add field dynamics to [PySoy](http://www.pysoy.org/){.http}. His work became soy.fields which compliments the rigid body physics provided by [ODE](http://www.ode.org/){.http}.

He\'s available as a mentor for 2009 for students who want to optimize and extend the work he started.
