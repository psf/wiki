Photo of me from [PyCon](PyCon) 2006, left-center of photo in grey shirt.

I\'ve been using Python since 1997, with my primary contributions being the Linux RPMs and related things. I\'d like to be more involved, but running a small business takes up most of my extra cycles. On the other hand, because it\'s my business, I get to use Python for most things, but it\'s Linux System Administration so mostly my coding is very small and has to run on older Pythons.
