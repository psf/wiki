You will spend most of your waking life communicating with other people.

Since you already know how to communicate in English and Python, why would you want to spend 4 days in an [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint) dedicated to helping others learn better communication?

1st Nearly all children begin speaking at 10 months.

2nd Most children under one system communicate at 3rd grade in 1st.

- [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches) will explain the difference & help you program it.

3rd Communication involves phonetics, morphology, orthography, phonology, syntax, semantics and much more. Japanese phonology consists of 8 rules. English phonology and many other parts of English are still partially undiscovered. [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches) will give you some algorithms for how to discover the debated parts of English.

4th Speech recognition and computer translation are still important unsolved computer problems. I started in computer science and linguistics in the early 1970\'s. The reason we could not do better speech recognition and computer translation was primarily because the linguists did not know what they were doing. Even less powerful languages before Python could have solved all of the computer science problems for speech recognition and inerrant fully automatic computer translations if the linguists could have explicitly stated all of the rules.

- [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint) will help you understand beginning or elementary linguistics. [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint) will help you understand why many of the linguistic systems are insufficient and therefore failures for solving problems like voice recognition and automatic machine translation.

- [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprintCoaches) will help you understand how to use the power of Python to uncover the linguistic system necessary to solve problems in education such as why Johnny had unnecessary problems in reading, writing, spelling, speech recognition, and translation. If we have more than a handful of Pythonic programmers [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EducationalSprint) will discover all of the linguistic rules in the most simple, most hotly debated, and most basic areas of English.
