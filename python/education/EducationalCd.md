[ThomasWaldmann](http://linuxwiki.org/ThomasWaldmann "LinuxWiki") has started concrete work on [PythonCd](PythonCd) (that\'s the main page for the wiki on the bootable CD).

Current thinking is to focus educational/scientific applications - interested beginners, include everything needed for starting

Please join the effort, there is lots of work to do!

History:

At [PyCon](PyCon) 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.

The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a \"Fat Python\" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [the python-grants list](http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants).

See also [PythonEducationalDistribution](http://www.seapig.org/PythonEducationalDistribution "SeaPig") by the Seattle Python Interest Group. They are creating a Windows CD. Also, the Python [EduSig](EduSig) list has discussed using [Morphix](http://www.morphix.org/modules/news/) to create a bootable custom CD. I would encourage you to get in touch with both these groups.
