# Kiwi

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
Kiwi is a graphical framework for developing applications with graphical user interfaces. It\'s a set of classes and wrappers for [PyGTK](http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk){.http} that were developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Roughly modeled on Smalltalk\'s MVC, Kiwi is not just a research project: its intention is becoming a practical and simple way to make building a UI the easiest and clearest possible.
