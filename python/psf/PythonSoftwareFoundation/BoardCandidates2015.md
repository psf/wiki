**Registering as a PSF Board candidate**

To register as a candidate for the Board elections, add your nomination to this page using the format listed at the end of the page. We\'d like as many groups within the PSF membership as possible to have the option of electing candidates that can directly represent their interests in Board discussions, so if there\'s someone you\'d particularly like to have represent you, you may want to consider getting in touch with them and (politely!) asking if they\'d be interested in nominating themselves.

While the overall time commitment will vary based on whether or not a Board member chooses to take on additional organizational responsibilities, candidates should be prepared to commit at least a few hours each week to assisting in managing the overall affairs of the Python Software Foundation (this is primarily a combination of mailing list discussions and 2x 1 hour IRC+teleconference based Board meetings each month). The Board quorum requirements are designed to handle the fact that not every Director will be able to make every Board meeting, especially given a global Board spanning a wide range of time zones.

Please note that the PSF bylaws require that Board candidates disclose significant organizational affiliations (for example, their employer).

### [Carrie Anne Philbin](#id1)

*New Board Member.*

I\'m an award winning secondary Computing & ICT Teacher, Author, and YouTuber from the UK. I currently lead the education mission for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. I am the author of \'Adventures in Raspberry Pi\' a computing book for teenagers wanting to get started with Raspberry Pi and programming (including Python). Winner of Teach Secondary magazine\'s Technology & Innovation Best Author award 2014 and Talk Talk\'s Digital Hero Award in 2013.

In 2011 I started a journey from teaching an uninspiring curriculum that showed young people how to consume technology to leading the Raspberry Pi Foundation\'s education mission to advance the education of adults and children in the fields of computing, computer science and related subjects. This would not have been possible without the Python community. I talked about this in my Pycon UK keynote called \'Miss-adventures in Raspberry Pi\' which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPLKsz6C_4). I think this gives some insight into what drives me. This year I\'ll be giving talks at both EuroPython and Pycon Australia, as both conferences begin to introduce education mini conferences.

For possibly the first time, the UK is leading the way in transforming the education curriculum, introducing computer science at the age of 5 and forms an integral part of learning throughout a child\'s school life. I believe that Python has the potential to be the text based programming language used in education worldwide. It is rapidly becoming the language of choice in schools across the UK. The Python community has been at the heart of this, creating free and open libraries that make computing accessible, and more importantly creative and fun. Two stand out examples would be the RPi.GPIO library, and Minecraft Pi API. The first, RPi.GPIO was created so that the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi could be programmed with Python, initially to brew beer, but quickly adopted by makers and educators and now forms an integral part of the Foundation\'s free learning resources. The Minecraft Pi API allows anyone to program something to happen in the minecraft world with Python. Want to make a house appear, rather than building one? A few lines of code makes this happen. Want that house to follow you around the map, a few more lines of code will make that happen. I can\'t think of any tool more powerful to hook children\'s playful, imaginative and creative minds.

This is a great starting point, but I\'d like to serve the PSF to help highlight great python education projects but also highlight where support is needed by the community. I\'d like to help foster a wider conversation between industry experts, programmers and educators. I\'d like to bring more teachers into the PSF.

I am the creator of a YouTube video series for teenage girls called The [Geek Gurl Diaries](http://www.geekgurldiaries.co.uk/). The episodes include interviews with women working in technology and hands on computer science based tutorials to inspire young people, particularly girls into STEM subjects and hopefully careers. In my role as Vice-Chair of Computing At Schools diversity initiative called [#include](http://casinclude.org.uk/), I help to organise and run conferences and hack days for teachers and industry experts to make computer science accessible to all regardless of gender, ethnicity, social economic status, special educational needs or disability. I would like to bring what I\'ve learned from this experience to support the PSF.

### [Marc-Andre Lemburg](#id2)

*2014 Board Member.*

You may know me as Python Core Developer. I have designed and implemented the [Unicode integration and codecs for Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0100/) and maintained it for more than a decade, among several other things in CPython.

More details about myself and what I\'ve done for the Python community since I joined it in 1993/1994 are available on my [wiki home page](MarcAndreLemburg).

I am a founding Fellow of the PSF, have been PSF board member in the years 2002-2004 and then again since 2010.

These are the things I\'d like to focus on for the 2015/2016 term:

- integrate the PSF more into the global Python community and make it\'s organizational structures more diverse and international to better represent the community than it does today (see [Python Events Calendars](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar) for a map showing how our community is structured)
- help (re)create a friendly, cheerful and open PSF community, where people can share their projects, ask for help, get others excited or simply hang out, without having to deal with the formalisms that come with a large organization such as the PSF
- make more use of the new PSF work group setup and work out the organizational details for this, to give more members a chance to actively participate in and use the PSF\'s resources to bring Python forward
- create a marketing work group to (a) develop a more diverse marketing strategy for Python which doesn\'t only focus on developers, (b) create more marketing material and tools to enable Python user groups and evangelists to better promote Python in their local and professional settings, and (c) create more [Python merchandise](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Merchandise)
- push for getting the python.org website setup with a real CMS in order to attract more content contributors and maintainers
- rewrite the [Python trademark policy](https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/) to make it more readable and straight forward to use
- get the PSF to adopt [more community friendly PyPI terms & conditions](https://bitbucket.org/malemburg/pypi-terms/src/9148ddefb40fa84e8c0ffaad055bd1fc6f333900/pypi-terms.md?at=default)
- if we can get PSF funding, help create a second volume of the [PSF Python Brochure](http://brochure.getpython.info/)

I\'d like to continue my work as director and look forward to another year serving on the board.

PSF things I\'ve been working on in the 2014/2015 term:

- ran the [PSF Python Brochure project](http://brochure.getpython.info/), which has so far been a great success by providing a nice tool for Python community members to promote Python; the first edition was available for PyCon 2014 in Montreal, the second for PyCon 2015; also see the [PSF Python Brochure wiki page](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Python%20Brochure)
- continued worked with the [Python Events Calendars](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar) team to run a central place where Python users can lookup Python events; calendars are shown on [https://www.python.org/events/python-events/](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/), [http://www.pycon.org/](http://www.pycon.org/) and also available as [map mashup](http://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/).
- took the European [PSF Conference Kit](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Conference%20Kit) to several conferences (EuroPython, FOSDEM, PythonCamp Cologne) to show PSF support; created new carry-on displays for StephaneWirtel to use for Python events in Belgium and France.
- created and sent out [giveaway marketing material](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Merchandise) for use at Python conferences and by user groups (flyers, stickers)
- promoted the PSF at conferences in Europe, giving [talks](https://wiki.python.org/psf/MembershipModelTalks) and available as contact for people interested in the PSF (EuroPython, PyCon UK, PyCon DE, FOSDEM, PythonCamp Cologne)
- managed the central [PSF domain management](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Domains) account at Gandi.net, transferred and registered more domains to that account
- created and managed the central [PSF SSL certificate management](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20SSL%20Certificates) accounts at StartSSL and Gandi.net
- administered the [Python, Jython and PSF wiki systems](https://wikis.python.org/) together with the volunteers on the [pydotorg-www mailing list](mailto:pydotorg-www@python.org), helped setup the new editors scheme to prevent wiki admin burnout due to very frequent spamming and vandalism of the wikis.
- administered the [http://www.pycon.org/](http://www.pycon.org/) page and the pycon.org domain (which I\'ve owned from 2003-2012 before contributing it to the PSF)
- ran the [new Python Job Board team](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PSF%20Python%20Job%20Board) together with initially 30 volunteers; pushed for jobs app implementation changes and worked on the final ones to be able to finally [launch the new Python Job Board on 2015-03-19](http://pyfound.blogspot.de/2015/03/psf-python-job-board-relaunched.html)
- contacted new potential PSF sponsors as part of creating a more [diverse PSF marketing strategy](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Board/marketing-psf)
- built closer relationships with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), getting joint blog posts running and investigating possible closer collaboration on education workshops
- a lot of the above relates directly with my PSF work to create [closer ties with the Python community](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Community%20Relations)

in addition to the usual PSF board and [trademark committee](https://wiki.python.org/psf/TrademarksCommittee) work.

Other Python community projects I\'m currently involved in:

- [EuroPython Society (EPS)](http://www.europython-society.org/) - I\'m a board member of the EPS, which is the organization running the [EuroPython](http://europython.eu/) conference series; this uses a [work group structure](https://ep2015.europython.eu/en/volunteers/) similar to the one the PSF wants to use, but we actually have it working already for the 2015 edition of the conference
- [Python Meeting Düsseldorf (PyDDF)](http://pyddf.de/) - Together with Charlie Clark, I started a local Python user meeting series in Düsseldorf in 2012; we\'re having quarterly meetings with talks, discussions; videos are available in our [PyDDF YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/pyddf/)

### [Alex Gaynor](#id3)

*2014 Board Member*

I\'ve served as a board member for the past two years.

In the last year, here are some of the things I\'ve worked on:

### [Alyssa Coghlan](#id4)

*2014 Board Member.*

I have been a part of the Python community for more than a decade, a CPython core developer since 2005, and a member of the Board of Directors since 2014. ([Full bio on personal site](http://www.curiousefficiency.org/pages/about))

As a PSF board member, my two primary concerns would be addressing the challenges the PSF faces around volunteer burnout (including for Board members), as well as continuing to address the long term structural risks potentially impacting the sustainable operation of PSF provided infrastructure and services.

Key perspectives I believe I bring to Board discussions:

- Experienced CPython core developer
- Heavily involved in the Python software distribution & deployment ecosystem
- Employed by a major commercial redistributor of Python
- Professional training and experience in infrastructural risk management

Specific initiatives I would personally be aiming to advocate for and participate in over the 2015/2016 Board term include:

> - Providing additional community visibility into the ongoing activities of the PSF Board through the [Strategic Decision Making Process](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/ProposalsForDiscussion/StrategicDecisionMakingProcess) proposal
> - Enhancing the PSF\'s ability to suitably recognise contributions to the broader Python community through the updated [PSF Fellowship Recognition Program](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/ProposalsForDiscussion/FellowshipRecognitionProgram) proposal
> - Providing a more constructive framework for discussions regarding the allocation of PSF funds and effective direction of volunteer time and energy by capturing and clearly documenting agreed [strategic priorities](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/ProposalsForDiscussion/StrategicPriorities) for the PSF (which also includes clearly documenting things the PSF *isn\'t* doing itself, as other organisations are better positioned to handle them)
> - Working with the PSF Events Coordinator and other PSF Directors to finalise and publish the \"International PyCon Prospectus\" (a proposal developed in collaboration with a number of conferences the PSF has previously sponsored). The intent of this proposal is to allow other organisations to easily sponsor multiple regional conferences via the PSF, rather than having to arrange payment individually with each conference throughout the year
> - Working with Selena Deckelmann on a Strategic Hiring Plan proposal for the PSF, with the aim of enhancing the PSF\'s core staff and volunteer management capabilities to help reduce the incidence of volunteer burnout within the Python community

### [Ashwini Oruganti](#id9)

*New Board Member.*

I love the Python community, and I have learnt a lot from it. I want to be an active leader in its journey towards becoming a bigger and more diverse place for everyone in the world.

- I have been a long time [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) core developer. I started out as a mentee, and grew to be a mentor to new Twisted contributors, through the Google Summer of Code programs under the PSF umbrella.
- I worked on [HippyVM](http://hippyvm.com/), a high-performance PHP Virtual Machine using the PyPy toolchain. I built the technical underpinnings that made it possible to run two major open source content management systems through Hippy:­­ WordPress and MediaWiki.
- I am the author of [Python Cryptographic Authority's TLS](https://github.com/pyca/tls), an easy-to-use, opinionated, and secure TLS 1.2 implementation in Python. I was awarded the [Stripe's Open Source Retreat](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat) grant for this project.
- As a member of the PyCon 2015 program committee, I reviewed and helped select talk proposals.
- I am the Financial Aid Chair for PyCon 2016. I will be leading the Financial Aid committee in spreading the funding to provide assistance to and cover expenses (such as reimbursement for travel, lodging in the various conference hotels, or the conference admission) of as many applicants as possible.
- I have been speaking, mentoring, and volunteering at regional and international Python conferences and events, such as, PyCon North America 2013, 2014, and 2015, PyCon Dublin 2013, PyTennessee 2015.

As the Python user base and community grows, there have been some hiccups along the way. My goals are to:

- create a more diverse and welcoming community, with more initiatives and a diverse perspective respectful to all cultures, both geographical and social. I grew up in India and have collaborated with open source developers across the US, Europe, and South Africa. I have personal cross-cultural experience required for achieving this goal.
- work on bringing more transparency in the processes, mailing lists, and activities of the Foundation, so as to encourage better and more diverse participation.
- encourage, support, and lead global community development, support more Python conferences and events, as well as provide assistance to a diverse audience in attending said events.

Affiliation: I will be joining Eventbrite in May 2015.

### [Anna Ossowski](#id13)

*New Board Member.*

I love the Python community with all my heart! I recently wrote a [blog post](http://anna-oz.tumblr.com/post/117173382150/dear-python-a-love-letter-to-python-and-the) about the awesome things the Python community has done for me and what a positive impact it had on my life. I would like to help maintain this positive environment and make it even better. I am very passionate about diversity and community outreach and would like to encourage more people of underrepresented groups, especially women, to learn programming in Python, attend conferences, and get involved in the community because it's awesome!

A little bit about me:

- I am very involved in Django Girls. I am a Django Girls organizer (co-organized Django Girls Budapest and Django Girls @ PyCon 2015, more events in the making) and also run the "Your Django Story" interview series on the [Django Girls blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org) where I highlight one awesome woman and her work each week. I also mentor women in my free time and help other Django Girls organizers make their events awesome.
- I spoke for the first time at this year's PyTennessee about "Django Girls: A success story". I plan on speaking at more meet-ups and conferences in the future.
- I am a member of the Django Software Foundation grants committee and recently created a draft for the new DSF grants policy.
- I helped review/select talks for PyCon 2015 as a member of the program committee.
- I will join the tutorial committee for PyCon 2016.
- I am currently working on building the "PyLadies Remote" chapter with online content for everyone who doesn't live near a PyLadies chapter and therefore doesn't have the possibility to attend meet-ups.
- I will help with diversity work for the [Open Tech School conference](http://otsconf.com) in Dortmund, Germany in August this year.
- I write a series called "Understanding Computer Words" for programming beginners on my blog. It is important to me to help beginners and encourage them on their programming learning journey.

What I would like to work on:

- Increase and broaden the PSF's diversity efforts. I would like to keep working on bringing more women into the community but also extend the diversity work to increase the diversity of other underrepresented groups in the Python community.
- Find more financial aid sponsors and work on extending the financial aid program. If it wasn't for the great financial aid programs I wouldn't have been able to attend conferences and get involved in the community. It is important to me to support as many people as possible and make it possible for them to attend conferences. I would also like to explore how the PSF could help smaller and regional Python conferences offer financial aid to their attendees.
- Help with the communication between PSF and DSF as far as grants etc. are concerned.
- Explore how the PSF can support educational programs like Django Girls more. As a self-taught programmer workshops like Django Girls have really helped me gain new skills and support on my programming journey. I believe that educational programs like Django Girls are one of the best ways to increase diversity and bring more people into the Python community.
- Lead initiatives to help Python users in remote areas without access to user groups.
- Help increase the PSF\'s global/international reach.
- Help make the PSF's processes more transparent and increase/improve communication with the community.

### [Naomi Ceder](#id15)

*New Board Member*

I\'ve been using, promoting and teaching Python on various levels since 2000, as a teacher, author, developer, manager, and organizer.

- Founded Trans\*Code, the first hackday series in Europe and UK to exclusively focus on issues of the transgender community
- Served on the Code of Conduct response committee at EuroPython 2014
- Presenter at the Education Track at PyCon UK 2014
- On organizing committee for PyCon UK 2015, working on diversity and outreach.
- Co-chair of PyCon Sprints in 2015 and organized the first PyCon Intro to Sprinting workshop (presented by Open Hatch)
- Created/coordinated the first two education summits at PyCon, which each had about 80 attendees from all areas of Python education.
- Created the poster session at PyCon and coordinated it for 3 years
- Author of The Quick Python Book, 2nd ed., which was Manning Publications\' number 2 selling book in 2012 and in the top 10 sellers over all for the past few years.
- Presenter of various Python talks and tutorials in USA and Europe, including talks at PyCon, EuroPython, and PyCon UK. I have taught Python to teachers, system admins, kids, newcomers to Python and programming, etc.
- Currently based in London, UK. Work with Python developers in USA, UK, Germany, Japan, China.

As IT director/architect of a company that runs on Python I\'m very interested in the long term health and growth of Python and the Python community, and my personal circumstances have given me some very personal experience with diversity and inclusion from several different, and even contradictory, perspectives. I know well what it\'s like both to be privileged and marginalized simply because of who I am.

**My goals for 2015/2016** as a board member would be to do all that I can to help the PSF achieve its mission in any way that I can. In particular, I\'m interested in:

- **Foster Diversity** - Diversity means more than increasing the numbers of women or nationalities (though both of those are important) - it involves thinking about a wide range of axes - race, ethnicity, disability, neurodiversity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, economic background, etc. I want to ensure that the Python community is as inclusive and welcoming as possible along all of those axes and more.
- **Develop New Leaders** - I believe that for an organization to be inclusive thought and effort must be put into opening all aspects to new people. My practice has been to deliberately hand off projects I\'ve started as soon as practical once they are established, and I would view a board position the same way. I would also encourage and support a healthy turnover in board committee and working group leadership and membership, so that more people gain leadership experience.
- **Support Education** - Support for education is more than funding workshops - I\'d like to encourage initiatives to improve pedagogy, tools, and resources for the various groups teaching Python, perhaps starting with a working group aimed at curricula and teaching resources.
- **Evolve PSF management** - As the community grows, the role of the PSF board needs to adapt. I support changes to make the PSF board have more of an oversight role and to develop other means to handle managerial and executive duties.

Finally, I take commitments to positions like this seriously - I absolutely hate to miss meetings or deadlines, and I make sure tasks I\'m assigned \"just get done\" with as little fuss as possible.

### [Van Lindberg](#id16)

*2014 Board Member*

I\'ve been involved with the PSF for about nine years now, serving as a chair or co-chair of PyCon US, outside counsel for the PSF, and most recently a board member and chairman of the board of the PSF. I recently [described a lot of what the PSF does](./described(20)a(20)lot(20)of(20)what(20)the(20)PSF(20)does.html). Personally, I try to focus on things that are lost in the weeds but need to get done. I want to make sure that the operational infrastructure of the PSF keeps working. Kindness and professionalism are also important to me, and I strive to both model those characteristics and encourage them in the broader Python community.

My goals for the next year:

- **Develop our capacity:** We have reached the point where our operational capabilities are being strained. I want to make sure that both Ewa (PSF Secretary, logistical planner, and all-around doer) and Kurt (PSF Treasurer) have backup. *This is the most important thing we can accomplish this upcoming year.*
- **Support Python in education:** We have a huge opportunity to introduce Python to an entire new generation. I\'m working with a number of different organizations to provide free, open-licensed teaching materials that help people use Python to teach computing. Also, in conjunction with the Python in UK Education working group, the PSF is an official supporter for the BBC Microbit, a Python- programmable miniature development board that will be released later this year. These are ongoing and important efforts that I want to continue.

I also want to continue the following:

- **Trademark management:** Over the past year, I have helped make sure that the \"Python,\" \"PyCon,\" \"PyLadies,\" and two-snakes logos are trademarked or under trademark examination in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. This work is ongoing, and I want to continue it. It is necessary to make sure that \"Python\" and the other marks of our community aren\'t misused.
- **Support for local conferences:** This year we were able to help a number of local conferences with logistics and financing. We are putting together an international sponsorship package that will help make it easier for corporate sponsors to support more conferences in more places. This is a tricky legal, financial, and social project, but I think it can help grow the community worldwide.
- **Work on pydotorg:** I have been working to continue the development of pydotorg for the past 6-8 months, after it had been left aside for a while. The current work is on making it easier for many people to contribute content, identifying \"owners\" for portions of the website so that they don\'t go out of date, and moving the whole infrastructure (including design) to public github.

### [Riaz Moola](#id18)

*New Board Member*

(Nominated by David Mertz)

David Mertz statement in support: *Riaz has done a series of amazing training and outreach efforts to disadvantaged groups in South Africa, including educationally underserved students generally, and a new program for prisoners and former prisoners who can gain skill with programming education. He is ambitious, driven, conscientious, and already (at a young age) a leading light of outreach and education*

I am a South African citizen, and permanently reside in the city of Durban. In my first year of my undergraduate degree, I studied at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) in Durban at a campus previously open to only non-white students during Apartheid (and hence the only university my parents were allowed to study at). Only 200 out of approximately 1000 of my Computer Science classmates in first semester made it to the second semester of studies, and even fewer into the second year. The lack of foundational IT knowledge was astounding, and I became even more aware of it when I participated in an exchange programme with Keele University in England during my third semester.

During my second year of studies, I was introduced to Python and felt strongly about its potential to help new programmers learn fundamental concepts. In July 2012, I founded the organisation Hyperion Development (www.hyperiondev.com), created a simple online course and website, and returned to the UKZN classes I had previously taken, urging students to sign up. In April 2015:

- Hyperion is now the largest online course platform for aspiring programmers in South Africa, with several thousand users that come from approximately 95% of all tertiary institutions in South Africa.
- Hyperion is entirely run and managed by a team of part-time university students based in the UK and SA. The team size has been between 20 and 40 members, selected from a pool of \>250 applicants. I oversee 5 teams maintaining 7 courses (with a focus on Python and C++), with team members based in 8 cities.
- We were awarded a UK Open Source Award, an Innovation Initiative Grant from the University of Edinburgh Development Trust, four grants from the Python Software Foundation (July/August 2013, June 2014, January 2015), invited as speakers at the first PyCon in South Africa.
- We have worked to improve IT standards at a high school level, by training nearly half of all Information Technology high school teachers in South Africa in a series of workshops delivered in Cape Town and Durban for the South African Department of Education, with funding from Oracle, and building and installing 50 \'Hyperion Boxes\' - a low cost computer built from Raspberry Pi\'s - in 6 rural schools serving disadvantaged populations in rural South Africa - working with the South African Department of Wildlife and Agriculture.
- Hyperion is now recognised as a leading provider of Python training in South Africa, with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (the largest R+D organisation in Africa) choosing us to deliver 6 workshops in Python (beginner, intermediate, advanced) for a total of 120 attendees to train their researchers in Python. 3 of these workshops have now been delivered, with excellent feedback.
- Our team of student programmers, ranging from first year to PhD students, have built the Hyperion \'Virtual Learning Environment\' which is adapted to the needs of SA students. We ensure that our course can be taken by students with limited access to internet and computers, that additional support mechanisms are in place on campuses across the country.

My goals for 2015/16 are aligned with those of Hyperion and the PSF:

- There are unparalleled opportunities to help improve the lives of others in Africa, especially in the space of education, and even more so in the space of technical education. I\'d like to reach these demographics more, through programmes with local partners. For example, Hyperion has begun working with Brothers For All ([http://www.brothersforall.org/](http://www.brothersforall.org/)) in Cape Town, to reach prisoners in the Western Cape that are seeking to transform their lives through programming education. This initiative is headed by an ex-prisoner. who manages a coding centre in the heart of a township (see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township\_(South_Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(South_Africa))).
- Related to the above is the need for a total reform of high school IT education for thousands in South Africa. During our teacher training projects, we repeatedly pushed for Python to be introduced as the new language to be taught in all high schools. We remain in contact with the two government bodies that oversee IT education in half the country, and see this as a long term goal that is achievable.
- I\'m interested in sustainable but effective models of Python education. Our online Python courses offer a unique level of support, with students teaching other students, and I\'d like to see how Python developers and educators around the world can collaborate more to help others learn this language.
- I\'d like to engage more with organisations that are serious about contributing to IT development in Africa. For example, I currently study in a department where the Raspberry Pi was created, yet it has proven exceptionally hard to engage with the Raspberry Pi foundation in a meaningful way to support the above projects. Computer Science, programming, and IT are often not seen as the most urgent needs for those in Africa, hence local funding is scarce. We must connect the international community with the African community to balance the scales of education.

As a member of the PSF board, my involvement in the above projects and access to the Southern African community will extend the reach of the PSF to truly hard to reach places and people that are woefully underrepresented in the community.

Affiliation: I am currently a masters student, reading for a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science as a Gates Scholar at the University of Cambridge. I will intern as a Product Manager at Google this summer.

### [Roberto Rosario](#id19)

*New Board Member.*

Endorsement by AnnaRavenscroft *I\'d like to provide a hearty endorsement for Roberto Rosario. I met him during Pycon Italia, where he gave the best, bar none, explanation of pygame I\'ve ever seen. He has a lot of organizational experience (worked for the government of Puerto Rico) and is working on organizing the Latin America Python community (where we don\'t have a strong presence). Roberto has the energy and ability to help the PSF move forward in our quest to take over the world, ahem, I mean, save the world.*

My past contributions to the Python community have been as a developer releasing much code into the open. As a speaker, I have participated in DjangoCon, PyCon Italy, DjangoVillage, local Puerto Rico Python meetups and in other non Python events where I promote Python as an alternative such as Transparency Camp. I am a strong proponent of privacy protection and freedom of speech, have participated in panels and created software specifically to promote those goals. I also believe in the power of education and autodidactism and have promoted both at the junior level by direct action and by creating hackable and extendable educational video games using Python and Scratch.

Some of the things I\'ve worked on in the past years:

- Python pioneer in the Government of Puerto Rico, first as a consumer using it for internal projects since 2007 and then in 2013, creating Python and Django projects as part of my official policy as Director of Software Development for the Government of Puerto Rico.
- Sponsor of several Django projects: Migrations for Django kickstarter, Django REST Framework kickstarter, multiple template backend project for Django, High Performance Django book, Django Fellowship Program, among others.
- Primary sponsor of Include Girls, an initiative to increase the participation of women in STEM fields.
- Pioneer of civic hacking in Puerto Rico by hosting the first government sponsored hackathon.
- Pioneer of Government Open Data by helping create the policy and by creating the LIBRE API Engine software, based on Django.
- At my behest, Cryptico Corporation became the first Puerto Rican (and possibly Latin American) Django Software Foundating Corporate Member.
- Creator of Mayan EDMS, Attack of the Moronians, django-autoadmin, awesome-django, Descartes BI and LIBRE API Engine, protocol designer and core developer of the Open Relay project, a project designed to protect privacy and freedom of speech in the event the SOPA/PIPA legislations were approved.

Goals:

- Represent the Latin American Python community.
- Increase inclusivity of Latin American Python developers and users into the general Python communities.
- Make PyCon Latin America 2016 in Cuba a reality.
- Promote projects geared to increase children interest and participation in the Python language and sub projects.

### [Carol Willing](#id20)

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Van Lindberg)*

VanL: *I nominate Carol Willing for the PSF Board. I have been incredibly impressed with Carol since I was first introduced about a year ago. She not only gets things done, but she takes special care to help elevate others and help them get things done too. She is a valuable member of the Python community who would make a great addition to the board.*

From Carol\'s Bio:

Carol is currently a Geek-In-Residence at FabLab San Diego, an active contributor to open source projects, like OpenHatch, and an independent developer of hardware and software. Weaving her love of art, music, and nature with wearable soft circuits, she is developing an open hardware project to assist an in-home caregiver with gentle, compassionate support of a loved one with Alzheimer's.

Carol earned a BSE in Electrical Engineering from Duke University and an MS in Management from MIT. She has work experience in both small and large companies.

Python-wise, Carol is co-organizer of PyLadies San Diego and the San Diego Python User Group. She was also a PyCon Program Committee member for PyCon 2014 and PyCon 2015, and on the tutorial committee for PyCon 2015. She also has extensive experience with other communities and conferences - see [https://willingconsulting.com/events/](https://willingconsulting.com/events/).

**My Python guiding principles**

- **Mahalo:** Thank you for sharing your knowledge, creating a wonderful language, and learning along the journey.
- **Change:** Is change good or bad relative to the past? Likely neither, the present is simply different than the past.
- **Aloha:** Farewell and welcome. Many existing methods, while serving Python well as the community grew, could be improved to meet present and future Python community needs. Does that mean that these older methods are bad? Not necessarily, it\'s just time to refactor the methods that don\'t serve us as well now. So, we say a warm Aloha farewell to some things and a respectful Mahalo for what these things have given us.

**My commitment to the community**

- Aloha, welcome to Python.
- Mahalo moves our community to meet the changing times, challenges, and opportunities while honoring our past.
- Surfs up. Be gracious, listen to each other, and ride the positive waves.

**Goals**

- Use our unique strengths in scientific computing and data analysis (NumFocus and PyData) to expand our educational outreach.
- Move toward non-profit best practices for accessibility of information.
- Foster self organizing teams, simple tools, and workflows to support volunteers.

### [Adria Richards](#id21)

*New Board Member*

**Building Value Through Data-Driven Outreach Efforts**

Diversity is not about filling events and spaces with different kinds of people, it's about helping people make their interactions with others inclusive.

I\'m looking to collaborate with others in the Python community as a member of the PSF board to build a successful model for open source that is truly inclusive and diverse where members and leaders reflect that diversity, especially in terms of race, gender, non binary gender orientation, transgender identity as a valid construct, socioeconomic status and neurodiversity which includes autism, dyslexia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and PTSD.

I am ready to contribute value-based strategies that engage the Python community to make diversity not only a priority but a reality through active outreach. The opportunity for the PSF to take an active role to improve the cultural landscape in technology is now. When we invite everyone to help, we can address issues like more effectively.

- Creative problem solver of complex technology issues
- Technology and language agnostic (don\'t shoot just because I code in Python and Ruby!)
- 17 years in technology career delivering effective solutions for business needs
- Active participant in over 200 tech conferences, hackathons, user and meetup groups and hack nights spanning since 2004

**Activating Allies in the Python Community**

Existing and potential allies in the community often express they feel scrutinized under a microscope and are expected to jump through hoops and prove they are "good" allies. One of my goals is to start making positive ally behaviour visible in the community.

Existing programs and open source communities do not offer opportunities for men in technology to be allies. Without a feedback loop to learn more supportive behaviors in the workplace and improve communication with women and minorities, men are left with having to read articles online and follow Twitter accounts, hoping they\'ll \"get it\".

After attending PyCon 2015 this year, a heartfelt discussion on the diversity mailing list was started, prompting me to share an example of a Python developer who \"leveraged his privilege\" so I could get a chance to speak during a Q&A session.

- This resonated for Guido because he tweeted about it, *\"Be an active ally. E.g. when called on, pass your turn to a lesser privileged participant who\'s been waiting longer.\"* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/591292655751004161) . That means empowering people in the Python community to be transformed from passive bystanders into active allies is important.

**Living at the intersection of diversity and tech**

I\'m a biracial woman (Black and Jewish) who grew up in a socioeconomically disadvantaged household, moving from the Midwest to the San Francisco to pursue my career goals. In life I\'ve learned how embrace my and learn from my life experiences, neurodiversity and introverted nature rather than trying to hide them.

- Served as PyCon Program Committee Member 2013, 2015
- Active participant PyCon 2013, 2014, 2015
- Member of PyLadies SF chapter since 2012
- Advisor and hackathon mentor for [TransH4CK](http://transhack.org) since 2013
- Founded nonprofit organization in 2014 to close gaps in the technology pipeline
- Working on pilot teaching tech workers in Silicon Valley how to discard bias in favor of empirical evidence
- Significant teaching experience and curriculum development for in-person and online classrooms

**Youth Hackathon Project**

I have worked as lead consultant in partnership with [The Level Playing Field Institute (LPFI)](http://lpfi.org) in 2013 and [Black Girls Code](http://blackgirlscode.com) in 2014 and 2015 on hackathons for youth and my deliverables included:

- Developed event programming and served as primary contact for logistics
- Designed age appropriate curriculum and educational objectives.
- Designed and delivered training to technical mentors on working with youth
- Conducted customer development with stakeholders (students, parents, community partners)
- Administered surveys and aggregated results for qualitative summaries and highlights
- 85% of girls said they would attend another hackathon
- 95% of volunteers said they would like to mentor at another hackathon
- 91% of BGC girls agreed with this statement *\"My hackathon mentors have careers in technology and can be role models for girls like me\"*

I\'m a strong group organizer, detail orientated and value well run events by planning out logistics.

**Goals**

Support learning opportunities that leverage mentoring and collaboration

- Being mindful about that everyone\'s journey to Python is different. How can we rethink the onboarding of new Pythonistas? Not just new to coding but language refugees from PHP, Ruby, ASP/.NET so they stay around? How can we help members level up their mentoring skills? Creating a culture of appreciation for volunteers and their time is an effective way to increase engagement and participation in the Python community. Help men and women learn to be better allies through technical mentorship.

Create KPI's (Key Performance Indicators) for diversity efforts

- Measure outcomes against these metrics to evaluate how successful outreach efforts are. Have you noticed how often people are make decisions for others without passing the mic (giving them a chance to speak for themselves)? This lack of input from those we wish to help often delivers solutions that don't actually help anyone. Let\'s change this so customer development becomes a central theme in diversity efforts. Increase visibility of senior level women, women of color and People of Color (PoC) working in the industry. Find and lift up these stories of success as a strategy to attract more diversity to the Python community. Creating a safe space to examine, discuss and debug tech culture is long overdue.

Expand PSF sponsored diversity outreach efforts to include broader definition of diversity

- The growth of PyLadies has been phenomenal with chapters around the country (and world). It has been a beacon of hope for many in the Python community that things are getting better. With time and investment of resources, many more first-time female attendees have come to PyCon in recent years and given talks. It\'s time to expand this successful model to other historically underrepresented groups and provide more than free conference passes. For those of us with solid networks in tech, connecting all Pythonistas who want to \'level up\' their skills to technical mentoring and apprenticeship opportunities would be a game changer.

> - People of Color (PoC)
> - Transgender
> - Living in households where the total incomes is less than \$60,000
> - Children in the household qualify for free or reduced lunch

Diversity isn\'t really about color and gender. It\'s about equality, equity and empathy towards others. Let\'s work together to make the python community inclusive by design.

### [Jackie Kazil](#id22)

*New Board Member*

I have three passions, passions that drive most of what I do in life, including the work that I do in the Python community.

1.  Democracy
2.  Diversity
3.  Education

**Democracy**

Democracy means representing the people that elect you. This means being led with integrity and objectivity. I have an incredible drive for civic engagement. I am a trained journalist, which is a profession that seeks to empower the people that it serves.

**Diversity**

\'Diversity\' is often associated with gender and race, but diversity should be considered in the following terms (in no order of importance): gender, race, color, sexual preference, income, geography, national origin, differently abled, age, and family status.

The community needs to start taking a more active role in not just making individuals feel welcome, but inviting them into the community by directly reaching out.

**Education**

My mother, who risked her life to escape Communist Czechoslovakia said, \"You can have everything taken away from you\... your money, your home, the clothes on your back, but no one can take what is in your head.\"

My zest for educating others has been long standing. I am working to start two programs in the DC region that teach programming to folks that need skills training. Part of this is also helping with job placement after training.

**Summary**

I want to empower folks in the community to have their voices heard and institute and develop Python educational standards within the PSF.

**Things that I have done** (specifically in the programming community)

- Founded PyLadies DC, which has helped seed future growth worldwide.
- Assisted in development on new PyLadies chapters.
- PyLadies auction organizer PyCon 2015
- PyLadies auction helper, Pycon 2014, 2013
- PyCon Keynote committee 2015
- Talk or tutorial reviewer for PyCon or Scipy 2013, 2014, 2015
- PyCon Speaker 2012, 2013, 2015
- Led accessibility hackathon - #allyhack 2015
- Leader of DCFemTech
- Teaches Python in the local community
- Former leader (now-coorganizer of Django District)
- Founder of GeoDC
- Teaches Python journalists through IRE/NICAR, PyJournos, and sometimes Hacks and Hackers
- Building a Python library w/ fiends on Python library that does agent based modeling

### [Claudiu Popa](#id24)

*New Board Member.*

I believe that describing someone\'s technical involvement with Python means almost nothing for a position as PSF Director, where other skills should be praised and wanted instead. Nevertheless, I must oblige to the way of others in this matter:

- I\'m the maintainer of the popular Python static analysis tool, Pylint. Basically I\'m the only active maintainer and I spend most of my free time working on it, improving it, making it something actually useful for other people to use.
- I have a lot of big and small patches integrated into CPython. I\'m not a core developer yet, but someday I\'ll reach that point as well.

Regarding my other contributions to the evolution of Python and its ecosystem, I founded a romanian Python user group, RoPython. It went from a couple of meetups in the start to the first romanian Python national conference in just 6 months, where we had over 200 attendees. We currently managed to make other romanian Python communities to join our initiative, becoming after one year of activity the biggest romanian Python user group, with monthly meetups, a lot of sprints involving open source projects such as Pylint, CPython, Celery etc and big plans for the future. If we can obtain the PyCon trademark for Romania, we\'ll have our first PyCon this year and the core group of RoPython has a plan to hold EuroPython in Romania by 2017-2018.

All of this might not look as *exciting* and impressive as what other candidates did, but let me emphasize one big difference. I\'m coming from an eastern european country, which was under the communist regime for over 40 years. This stigmata is still hurting us, it created an environment which is filled with corruption and ignorance, attributes instilled in many of my compatriots. An incapable education system was one of my motives for creating RoPython, by promoting different ways of education, self-learning towards fulfillment and empathy. Many of my compatriots are living in the rural area of the country, where education is a joke and mechanical learning is an appraised skill. That doesn\'t mean that they are stupid, they are just not exposed to the knowledge and information which usually occurs in the urban area. I\'m emphasizing all this because for most of these people, diversity is nothing but a fancy word from the western world. I see many of the candidates using this word like it means the same for the rest of the world and I also see that most of their so called diversity efforts are happening in the western world, for the people living in the western world.

I have a clear idea and goals if I\'ll become a Board Director:

- in order to increase diversity, I\'ll try to convince the other board directors that diversity shouldn\'t be just a fancy word. In order to increase it, we also must show that we are willing to sacrifice our seat to let other people come to work towards Python\'s future. My plan is to have a rule that someone cannot be a Board Director for more than two mandates consecutively.
- continuing the same idea, if we are actually caring about diversity, we should show it through the Board Directors, by limiting the number of available seats per region. For instance, Africa, Asia, South America are underrepresented in the list of the past board members and in order to continue our growth as an open institution, we\'ll need to bring others from different cultural regions. Thus I\'ll try to bring to fruition a plan in which each region (continent) will have a maximum of three available seats for the Board Directors.
- I plan to create a PSF working group with the purpose of fostering education and promoting Python and its ecosystem in underdeveloped countries, not just by financing conferences and sprints, but by being proactive, discovering and contacting local groups from those areas and supporting them financially or in other ways for building a sustainable Python community there.

I\'m in no way a diplomat, but I\'m deep down more passionate towards removing this invisible wall that separates the Western world from the rest of it and for that I need to be where power is, in order to actually making a difference.
