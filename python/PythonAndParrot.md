# Python and Parrot {#Python_and_Parrot}

Parrot is an effort to write the equivalent of .Net\'s Common Language Runtime or the Java Virtual Machine for dynamically-typed scripting languages. The project is developed by the community working on Perl 6.

See [http://www.parrotcode.org](http://www.parrotcode.org){.http} and [the Parrot wiki.](http://www.vendian.org/parrot/wiki/){.http}

The Parrot source tree includes some support for Python, but it can\'t run very significant Python programs yet and no one seems to be actively working on it.
