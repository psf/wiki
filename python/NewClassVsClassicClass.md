# NewClassVsClassicClass

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
A \"New Class\" inherits from `object`{.backtick}. It is the only way to create a class in Python 3.

A \"Classic Class\" or \"old-style class\" is a class as it existed in Python 2.1 and before. They were retained through Python 2.7 for backwards compatibility, and were removed in Python 3. For more information on the differences, please see [previous versions of this page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NewClassVsClassicClass?action=recall&rev=20){.https}.
