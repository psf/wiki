# EasyInstall

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
EasyInstall (easy_install) gives you a quick and painless way to install packages remotely by connecting to the cheeseshop or even other websites via HTTP. It is somewhat analogous to the CPAN and PEAR tools for Perl and PHP, respectively.

Please see [EasyInstall](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall){.http} for more information on EasyInstall.
