There is a whole page devoted to people who have never programmed before: [http://www.python.org/doc/Newbies.html](http://www.python.org/doc/Newbies.html){.http}.

If you know how to program yourself, but want to teach it to others, the [SpecialInterestGroup](./SpecialInterestGroup.html){.nonexistent} [Python in Education](http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/){.http} might be for you.
