# Python-Friendly Web Hosting 

Python is a web-friendly language. From the standard web-related modules delivered with the core distribution to a wide variety of full-blown application servers, users can choose just the right set of tools to create sophisticated websites of all sorts. Individuals or small companies who don\'t want to manage their own server hardware need to locate companies who offer Python solutions.

These pages aim to help. Below are pages that list web hosting services separated into free and commercial offerings. The information provided is not meant to be exhaustive, but to give you an idea what sort of Python-related support they offer. For full details, visit the sites that interest you.

Know of a solution that\'s not listed here or information about a listed service that needs to be updated or deleted? Feel free to update these pages. Any or all of the following information would be helpful:

- What turnkey Python-based packages are available (e.g., Zope, Mailman, MoinMoin, PIL, Webware, etc)?

- What computer platforms are available?

- Shell access?

- Name, homepage, which table below would you best fit in?
