# Code {#Code}

Welcome to [JAM](JAM)\'s code page. Here you can find programs that were **originally** written by [JAM](JAM). I have now made this page Open Source. Anybody is free to edit these programs. Please do not vandalize this page. I hope to soon have .pyc files ready for those who do not like to mess around with source code. I hope that the programs improve from here on out.

If you make a change to one of the programs in this section of the Wiki, please be sure to tell everybody that you made a change by posting a notice at [JAM/Code/Changes](./JAM(2f)Code(2f)Changes.html){.nonexistent}.
