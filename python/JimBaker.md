I live in Longmont, Colorado, just outside of Boulder. This is a beautiful part of the world. I consult for [Zyasoft](http://zyasoft.com){.http} and lead the [Front Range Pythoneers](http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers){.http}, which is the Boulder Python users group. Here are some relevant links:

- [Blog](http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/){.http} - occasional useful info on concurrency, databases, Django, iterators, Jython, and what not in Python

- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/zyasoft){.http} - this gives a more corporate bio
