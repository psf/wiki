All [PyCon](PyCon) participants hailing from the Republic of Texas are invited to attend this short [Birds of a Feather](./Birds(20)of(20)a(20)Feather.html) session in Kennedy Int\'l Friday from 5:45pm - 6:30pm. We want to get as much feedback as possible to plan our next Texas Un-conference. We are tentatively planning to hold it in September in Austin. This will be a similar follow-on to last year\'s successful [gathering in Houston](http://pycamp.python.org/Texas/HomePage){.http}.
