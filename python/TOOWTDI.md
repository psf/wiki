\"There\'s Only One Way To Do It\"

This was the slogan [PythonLabs](./PythonLabs.html){.nonexistent} came up with for the T-shirts given away by the defunct [BeOpen](./BeOpen.html){.nonexistent} at OSCON 2000. It was meant as a tongue-in-cheek response to Larry Wall\'s Perl slogan \"There\'s more than one way to do it.\" but the community liked it and it has often been taken very seriously in language or library design discussions. The Zen of Python is more nuanced:

- There should be one\-- and preferably only one \--obvious way to do it.\
  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you\'re Dutch.
