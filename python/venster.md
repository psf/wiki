# venster

::: {#content dir="ltr" lang="en"}
Venster is a GUI tool for Python. [http://venster.sourceforge.net](http://venster.sourceforge.net){.http}

It appears to be a defunct project; it was last updated in 2004, and depends on the \"ctypes.com\" module, which has since been removed from ctypes. The replacement for ctypes.com, comtypes, does not implement several of the COM interfaces that Venster requires.

- \- It should not be too difficult to add the required interfaces to comtypes again, any takers?
