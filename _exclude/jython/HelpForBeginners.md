# Help for Beginners 

A [WikiWikiWeb](WikiWikiWeb) is a collaborative hypertext environment, with an emphasis on easy access to and modification of information.

You can edit any page by pressing the \"edit\" link. Depending on the selected user interface theme you may find this at the top, in the sidebar area or at the bottom of the page. Capitalized words joined together form a [WikiName](WikiName), which hyperlinks to another page. Clicking on the highlighted title searches for all pages that link to the current page. Links to pages which do not yet exist have different text color (usually gray) or have a question mark; just follow the link and you can add a definition. That is also the way to create a new page: add a new [WikiName](WikiName) to an existing page, save your modification, click on your new link and create the page (more details on [HelpOnPageCreation](HelpOnPageCreation)).

You are encouraged to edit the [WikiSandBox](WikiSandBox) whichever way you like. Please restrain yourself from editing other pages until you feel at home with the ways a wiki works.
