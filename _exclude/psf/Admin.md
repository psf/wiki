## Associate Membership 

Tasks:

\* making a change to a member\'s address/e-mail/etc.

\* getting a count of AMs. Better: getting a count of AMs over time (is

- membership increasing or not?)

\* send a monthly (or weekly?) set of e-mails to AMs whose membership

- is expiring or has expired, reminding them to renew.

\* send an informational e-mail to all of the AMs in good standing.

\* send an informational e-mail to all of the AMs in good standing,

- limiting the list further in some way, e.g. e-mailing all the AMs in DC/MD/VA about a nifty event in Washington DC.

\* changing the fields on the AM signup page.
