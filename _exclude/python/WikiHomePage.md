# Wiki Home Page 

A WikiHomePage is your personal page on a [WikiWikiWeb](WikiWikiWeb), where you can put information on how to contact you, your interests and skills, etc. It is the personal property of the owner (or whoever created it), so be careful when editing it.

When creating a WikiHomePage, place a link to [CategoryHomepage](CategoryHomepage) on the bottom of the page.

Note that such pages are \"owned\" by the respective person and should not be edited by others, except to leave a message to that person. To do so, just append your message to the page, after four dashes like so:

- ----
      Just saying Hi! -- JürgenHermann

## Creating a Home Page 

To create a home page for yourself, first you have to login into the wiki. Then:

- Either, if the theme offers a link showing your wiki user name (modern/modernized theme see top of screen), just click that link

- or click on *[FindPage](FindPage)* (here or the tab within the navigation bar at the top of the wiki page). At the bottom of the *FindPage*, carefully type in your user name in the **Go To Page** box. Be sure to use capitalization where required.

On the next page, just click on *Create my home page now!*.

Edit the page by adding your name at the top. Add your email address if you want other wiki users to be able to contact you directly. If you wish, you may add other personal information about yourself. Use the **Preview** or **Check Spelling** buttons to check your editing progress and then click the **Save Changes** button to save the page.
