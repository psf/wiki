## Jython Ideas 

### Porting Zope 

At [PyCon](PyCon), there was some talk of porting [Zope](Zope), or at least the ZODB, to [Jython](Jython). Zope Corp. seems interested in this, but they need Jython 2.2.

### Jython with Eclipse 

Is it possible to script [Eclipse](Eclipse) with [Jython](Jython)? If so, could we write a little tutorial?

[EclipsePythonIntegration](EclipsePythonIntegration) gives lots of help.

### Jython Success Stories 

We need some. If you know of any large commercial or non-commercial project that has used Jython with success (ideally shipping [Jython](Jython) code as all or part of a product), please add a note to [JythonSuccessStories](JythonSuccessStories). Someone will try to track down more information and interview those involved.

## Jython Problems 

- Jython does not work with [Kaffe](http://www.kaffe.org/), which is the only Java implementation that is light enough for the [Linux Terminal Server Project](http://www.ltsp.org/) (used in some schools).

## About this Page 

We discussed creating this page during a Jython BOF at [PyCon](PyCon) 2003.
