### [Introduction](#id1)

Starting in Jython 2.5, Python types are exposed from Java code by adding several different annotations to fields and methods on the Java class to define the fields and methods that will be visible on the resulting Python type. A bytecode processor then adds code to the compiled class to build the type\'s dict and descriptors. An Ant task, `org.python.expose.generate.ExposeTask`, handles finding the classes to expose, running the processor on them, and writing them back out. This document describes how to use this type exposing system.

### [Adding \@ExposedType and generating bytecode](#id2)

The first step in exposing a class is to use the `org.python.expose.ExposedType` annotation on the actual class to indicate that it should be exposed. This annotation goes on the class itself and has three optional fields. The first, `name`, defines what the type will be called in Python. If it isn\'t specified, the type\'s name is just assumed to be the same as the Java class name. The second field, `base`, indicates the base type this type extends. It must be another Java class that\'s likewise been annotated with `@ExposedType` and sets up the type hierarchy in Python. If unspecified, it\'s assumed that this type extends from the base newstyle Python type, `object`. Unlike classes defined in Python code, types defined in Java can only use single inheritance. The third, `isBaseType`, defines if this type can be subclassed from Python code. When unspecified this value defaults to true. Any type defined in CPython that lacks a Py_TPFLAGS_BASETYPE bit in its tp_flags should have isBaseType set to false in Jython.

Once the class has `@ExposedType` on it, it can be fed into the type bytecode processor to fill in the additional bytecode necessary to actually make the class work as a type. The resulting type won\'t have any fields or methods defined on it, but they can be added later. To make the Ant task aware of it, the newly exposed class needs to be added to `CoreExposed.includes` file in the base of the jython checkout. CoreExposed just contains a single line for each file to be exposed with the full class name as a path in it, ie `org/python/core/PyObject.class` for PyObject. After adding the class to CoreExposed, executing ant will compile the code and process the new bytecode.

### [Exposing methods with \@ExposedMethod](#id3)

To actually add methods to the type, they need to be exposed with `org.python.expose.ExposedMethod`. `@ExposedMethod` can be applied to non-static methods on the class that are public, protected or package protected. When the bytecode processor encounters an `@ExposedMethod`, it generates a new inner class extending PyMethodDescriptor that simply calls the annotated method when bound. Because it\'s being called from a method descriptor, and Python method descriptors are available on types regardless of their location in the inheritance hierarchy, it\'s generally **a good idea to make exposed methods final**. This ensures that subclasses won\'t override the behavior of the method, so the descriptor always calls the same code when accessed directly off of the type. Also, exposed methods should avoid to call other virtual methods, directly or indirectly, unless the interactions with subclasses overriding the invoked methods are clearly documented and understood.

The generated descriptor maps the generic PyObject `__call__` method into the actual exposed method. Like `__call__`, it will pass up to four arguments directly to the method. If more than four arguments are required, the method must take the generic `__call__` arguments, `PyObject[], String[]`. For methods with four or less arguments, the descriptor will also coerce its PyObject arguments into Strings or Java primitives if the method takes that type. If the PyObject can\'t be coerced to that type, a TypeException will be raised. If the argument isn\'t a String or primitive, it must be a regular PyObject and the method must do its own type checking.

The return type from the method can be coerced in a similar fashion. Returns of String and char will be wrapped in a PyString; int, byte and short in PyInteger; long in PyLong; float and double in PyFloat; and boolean in PyBoolean. If the method returns void, PyNone will be returned in its place. If it doesn\'t return any of these types, it must return PyObject.

As with `@ExposeType`, there are several fields on `@ExposedMethod` that control how it appears in Python. The `names` field operates similarly to the `name` field on `@ExposedType`, except that it accepts multiple values in case the method needs to appear under multiple names in the type. For instance, the method `int_toString` on `PyInteger` is exposed with `names = {"__repr__", "__str__"}` as it works as both `__repr__` and `__str__` for int. If `names` isn\'t specified, the Java method\'s name is used to determine what the method will be exposed as. If the name starts with the type name followed by an underscore, the method will be exposed as the portion of its name following the underscore. This allows final, package protected methods to be specified for types that on PyObject as well without requiring setting the name on all of them. For example, `PyInteger`\'s exposed method `int___add__` doesn\'t set names, so it appears in its type dict as `__add__`. If the method name doesn\'t start with the type name and an underscore, it\'s just exposed as the full method name.

The next field, `defaults`, allows the method to specify that some of its arguments are optional, and if they aren\'t supplied, what values fill in. If the Java method takes three arguments, and two defaults are given in the annotation, it can be called from Python with anywhere from one to three arguments. If only one argument is given, the first default is used for the second argument, and the second default for the third argument. If two arguments are given, the second default is again used for the third argument. If three arguments are given, the defaults are ignored. If only a single default is given, it will only be used for the final argument. As with argument coercion, defaults can only be used with methods taking up to four arguments. The defaults can take three types of values:

null
:   the String `null` produces a Java null

Py.None
:   the String `Py.None` produces the Python None value

primitive
:   if the method takes a Java primitive(boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float or double) in the default\'s position, the string will be parsed using the primtive type\'s Java wrapper(ie java.lang.Boolean for boolean)

The final field on `@ExposedMethod` is `type`. This field takes one of three MethodType enums. The aptly named default value, `DEFAULT`, indicates that the method descriptor should simply call the exposed method and return using the normal coercion directly. `BINARY` indicates that the method is a binary operation like `__add__` or `__sub__`. For these types, the descriptor checks if the method returned null, and if so, it raises a NotImplemented exception. This is generally used in the case where the binary method doesn\'t handle the passed in type. The `CMP` type is only for `__cmp__` methods. If used, it checks if the method returns `-2`, and if so, raises a TypeException. This is the same sort of type check that `BINARY` is doing with null.

### [Exposing fields with \@ExposedGet, \@ExposedSet and \@ExposedDelete](#id4)

A trio of annotations are used to expose a field on a type, each handling a different aspect of accessing the field. `@ExposedGet` takes care of read access. It can be applied to a method that takes no arguments and returns a value, or to a field. If on a method, that method will be called every time read access is made on that field on instances of the type. If on a field, the descriptor will just directly access that field on the instance and return it. `@ExposedSet` can also be applied to a field or a method. If used on a method, the method must take a single argument of the same type as the `@ExposedGet` with the same name. `@ExposedDelete` is only allowed on methods that return void and take no arguments. If specified, when `del typeinstance.fieldname` is invoked in Python, that delete method will be called. Neither `@ExposedDelete` or `@ExposedSet` can be used if an `@ExposedGet` of the same doesn\'t exist on the type. The names of the exposed field can be specified as `name` in the annotation, or if that isn\'t specified the name is taken directly from the name of the field or method.

### [Making the type instantiable with \@ExposedNew](#id5)

The final step in making a Java class usable as a Python type is to make the type instantiable by adding a `__new__` method to it. This is done with the `@ExposedNew` annotation. If there is no `@ExposedNew` in the class, the type won\'t be instantiable from Python. It can still be created from Java by calling its constructors directly. See `org.python.core.PyNone` for an example of this. However in most cases, a type should be creatable from Python so it needs an `@ExposedNew`. There are two ways it can be used, a simple way for types that allow their subtypes to completely override the `__new__` process, and a more complicated version for types that need to have their `__new__` invoked by every subclass.

In the simple form, `@ExposedNew` is applied to an instance method that takes the standard Jython call arguments, `PyObject[] args, String[] keywords`. In this form, the basic new functionality is handled by `org.python.core.PyOverridableNew` and the method annotated with `@ExposedNew` is called as \_\_init\_\_ as part of that process for instantiating the defined type directly. This allows subtypes to completely redefine new and create objects however they like.

In the more complex form, `@ExposedNew` must be applied to a static method that takes the arguments `PyNewWrapper new_, boolean init, PyType subtype, PyObject[] args, String[] keywords`. In this case, the method has full responsibility for creating and initting the object and will be invoked for every subtype of this exposed type. Essentially it\'s for object instantation that must be called for every instance of that object. See PyInteger\'s `int_new` for an example of this type of `@ExposedNew`.

With either form, there can be only one `@ExposedNew` per class.

### [Post-processing](#id6)

Exposing Python types involves creating classes that the class loader can find, and then (as above) calling PyType.fromClass() on some Class. The classes get created by the ExposedTypeProcessor class in org.python.expose.generate, but as of this writing (r5593), these classes are not included in the Jython jar. It is intended that eventually ExposedTypeProcessor and related classes will be shipped separately, as a support jar. Your build.xml should also have a clause that runs the ExposeTask on the relevant classes, like this:

    <taskdef name="expose" classname="org.python.expose.generate.ExposeTask">
      <classpath>
        <path refid="classpath" />
        <pathelement path="${compile.dir}" />
      </classpath>
    </taskdef>

    <expose srcdir="${compile.dir}"
            destdir="${exposed.dir}"
            includesfile="${base.dir}/JythonExposed.includes"/>

(Taken from jython\'s build.xml.) You probably want to make your non-preprocessed classes (all the ones in JythonExposed.includes) get compiled someplace else, and only have the compiled ones show up in this \"exposed\" directory, so that you don\'t have two versions of each class on your classpath, and be careful if you\'re using an IDE.
