# IRC Channel 

Welcome to our Jython\'s IRC community! Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python written in 100% Pure Java, and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus allows you to run Python on any Java platform. Join us in [#jython](irc://irc.freenode.net/jython) at Freenode.net and make Jython better. You could also use the [webchat interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=jython&prompt=1).
