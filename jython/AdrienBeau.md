## Adrien Beau {#Adrien_Beau}

I\'m a software engineer working with Java technologies on a daily basis. I\'ve also been dabbling in Python for quite some time. So, it\'s only natural that I am very interested in Jython.

You can leave me a message on this page, or you can mail me at gmail.com. Don\'t expect timely replies, even though I will eventually answer.
