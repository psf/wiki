Another great month of Jython triumph. It seems to be the norm as of late, Jython continues to get better and the community continues to grow. The [NbPython](./NbPython.html){.nonexistent} project, aimed at providing Jython support in the Netbeans IDE, continues to advance. The Jython developers continue to plug away on the 2.5 release as you read. Jython websites based on the Django framework are now possible. It seems as though the language is on a roll.

Jython Monthly will be hosting another community interview over the course of the next few weeks. This time, we will be interviewing Jim Baker, a Jython developer and expert. See below for more details\...

I plan to revamp the Jython Monthly newsletter over the next month or two. I\'d like to try and spruce up the newsletter a bit and include a more formal news section each month. I am going over some ideas at this time, and if you have any suggestions or things you\'d like to see included, please send them my way. Any feedback is appreciated.

If you have any questions or comments regarding this month\'s newsletter, please feel free to send them to me.

My information is as follows:

[\*New\* Jython Basics - Decorators](http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/August2008/1){.http}

*Submitted By: Josh Juneau*

A new era in Jython development has arrived. We Jython developers will soon be able to begin harnessing many of the powerful features of the current Python language distribution. Using the latest alpha release of Jython (2.5a+), we can take a look at these new features today. Python is a language whose popularity has grown tremendously over the past several years, partially due to the great features that have been added. One of the newer features are known as decorators, which may appear daunting at first due to their odd syntax. As many Jython developers are also Java gurus, the syntax may look strikingly similar to the JavaEE Annotation. However, the Jython decorator is significantly different yet equally as powerful.
