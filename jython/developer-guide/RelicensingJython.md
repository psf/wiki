From 2.2 forward, Jython is using the PSF license. To use it, all new contributors need to send in the [PSF contribution form](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/). The form allows the PSF to relicense the code the contributor has written under its own license, and if the need arises, to change the license in the future; the contributor still retains the copyright for the work. See the [contribution agreement](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/) page for more detail.
