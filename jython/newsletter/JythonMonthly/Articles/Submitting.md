```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

If you are interested in posting an article, please create a new wiki page and name it [http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY/n](http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY/n) where \"Month\" is the newsletter month, \"YYYY\" is the newsletter year, and \"n\" is the next article in the sequence.

You can then add that link onto the main MonthYYYY article page: ([http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY](http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY)) .
