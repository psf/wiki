What a great time to be a Python or Jython fan\...seems like these two languages are growing by leaps and bounds. We\'ve had another great beta for the 2.5 release, and it sounds like development is continuing along quite nicely.

[PyCon](./PyCon.html) 2009 is in the near future, you can almost see it on the horizon. It is gearing up to be a great event, there will be several good Jython presentations to see. A summarized list of the Jython-specific presentation is as follows:

**Panel: Python VMs**: Speakers are Brett Cannon, Robort Viehland, Holger Krekel, Jacob Kaplan-Moss, and Jim Baker. This panel will bring together all four major implementations of Python in one room to answer questions from the public for the first time.

**Jython Progress**: In this presentation, Frank Wierzbicki will highlight some of the most interesting advances that have occurred in the 2.5 release of Jython, and also some of the new things being developed for 2.7 and 3.0.

**A better Python for the JVM**: Tobias Ivarsson - his consists of advanced discussions regarding the prototype for an optimizing compiler for Jython.

**Pylons on Jython**: Philp Jenvey - Will present how you can use lightweight, flexible Pylons web framework to create web apps on Jython.

**Django on Jython**: Presenters will be Jim Baker and Leo Soto. The discussion will obviously focus on the most popular Python web framework known as Django. They will show examples of how to use Django on Jython and other discussions.

Not long after [PyCon](./PyCon.html) 2009, Europython 2009 will run at the end of June. More details to come.
