### Standalone mode - Libraries included 

[http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/July2006/2](http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/July2006/2)

*Submitted by: Oti*

Jython has now a standalone mode, where the core part is all included in one single `jython.jar`{.backtick} file. This has two advantages:

- simpler starting: `java -jar jython.jar`{.backtick}

- simpler embedding: just put `jython.jar`{.backtick} onto your classpath. No setting of `python.home`{.backtick} nor `python.path`{.backtick} required.

This really adds a Plug & Play feature to Jython.

There is a preview available ([snapshot build](http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ohumbel/jython_2837.jar)).

A sample install and run session, after downloading `jython_2837.jar`{.backtick}:

    [root@localhost downloads]# java -jar jython_2837.jar -s -d /tmp/jython_standalone -t standalone
    Performing silent installation

    Congratulations! You successfully installed Jython HEAD to directory /tmp/jython_standalone.

    [root@localhost downloads]# cd /tmp/jython_standalone/

    >>> import getopt
    >>> 

One Open issue: the cachedir problem still remains. If the directory containing `jython.jar`{.backtick} is not writable, no cachedir will help importing java classes. This is a well known problem also persistent in non-standalone mode. We try to improve this in standalone mode.

# Tips and Tricks 

### Jython Function Behavior 

A useful thing to note about defining Jython functions with keyword parameters: The default values are only created once, at function compilation-time.

For instance, if the default value you're supplying is [MyClass](./MyClass.html)(5, 6, 7), you might be surprised to discover that the same instance gets used with every function call.

This trick can be used to make an equivalent to C's static local variables. Try this:

    def foo(item, acc=[]):
        acc.append(item)
        return acc

Now call foo a few times providing different numbers.

    >>> foo(5)
    [5]
    >>> foo(6)
    [5, 6]
    >>> foo(7)
    [5, 6, 7]

I'm sure there are much more interesting uses for this than my contrived little example, but you get the idea.

### How to use the Wiki 

Learn to use the Jython wiki for posting articles and tutorials. Help and build the Jython library! Wiki renders as html and can use css and images. It is a great tool for posting content quickly in an organized environment. Create an account and use the wiki help to get started today.

Here is an example provided by Clark Updike:

Here\'s the main page (rendered as HTML): [http://wiki.python.org/jython/FrontPage](http://wiki.python.org/jython/FrontPage)

Test your skills with the Coolaps Developer Challenge: There are two ways to compete - the best application that runs on Sun Grid Compute Utility, and the best application built with the Compute Server Plugin for [NetBeans](./NetBeans.html). We designed things this way to allow as many people as possible to participate, including International participants, who cannot access the Sun Grid Compute Utility today.

### Question from leouser to the community 

Id like to compile a list of things that would improve [Jython Shell](https://jythonshell.dev.java.net) and am curious if there are any users out there in the general Jython community that have any ideas.

I have one: Let the user alter the font from the GUI. After taking the shell to different platforms, Ive come to the conclusion that just using the supplied font is not always a good thing. Im considering adding a font chooser panel. Something at least that will let the user change the blasted font.

Any other ideas? *Please send thoughts to the Jython-Users list*

# Interested in Developing Jython? 

If you are interested in developing Jython, please take a look at the [current bug listing](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=12867&atid=112867) and submit patches for items which you can repair.

# Who\'s Using Jython? 

## Dojo Toolkit 

The Dojo Javascript Toolkit is utilizing Jython\'s ANT capabilites for their build process. Take a look at this powerful toolkit\...it is worth the time! [http://dojotoolkit.org](http://dojotoolkit.org)
