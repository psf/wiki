[Transforming with XSLT on Google AppEngine and Jython](http://jython.xhaus.com/transforming-with-xslt-on-google-appengine-and-jython/) - Alan Kennedy

I'm writing this post in response to a challenge. I wrote a post entitled Jython on Google [AppEngine](./AppEngine.html): Why bother?, which was a reply to a statement made by a Google engineer about not seeing the point of running jython on [AppEngine](./AppEngine.html). And a similar statement was repeated in a comment on that blog post (i.e. "the gist of what I intended to say was that while it was possible to run Jython on App Engine, I couldn't think why you'd want to.")

[Jython on Google Appengine, Why Bother?](http://jython.xhaus.com/jython-on-google-appengine-why-bother/) - Alan Kennedy

Why on earth would you want to run jython applications on Google [AppEngine](./AppEngine.html)?

First off, I must apologise for the flippant nature of the attention grabbing title. I'm a jython committer, and a jython user, so I believe that there are very good reasons for running jython on Google [AppEngine](./AppEngine.html). (You can read how to do so on the modjy wiki: how to run jython applications on Google [AppEngine](./AppEngine.html)). [Read More](http://jython.xhaus.com/jython-on-google-appengine-why-bother/)

[Google Programming Preferences, the Python Ultimatum](http://arnoldit.com/wordpress/2009/12/06/google-programming-preferences-the-python-edition/) - Stephan E. Arnold

A thread on Google Groups' Unladen-Swallow tackled the question of what programming languages are encouraged or discouraged at Google. At the conference in London on December 2, 2009, I heard that Microsoft wanted developers to use Visual Studio.net, yet Windows 7 and other Windows products were anchored in Assembly language and C, often undocumented Assembly language and C. Whether true or not, the resulting conversation triggered on person to mention the Unladen Swallow thread.

[Python History Intro](http://articles-on-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/introduction-and-overview.html) - Doncrack at History Articles

Python is currently one of the most popular dynamic programming languages, along with Perl, Tcl, PHP, and newcomer Ruby. Although it is often viewed as a \"scripting\" language, it is really a general purpose programming language along the lines of Lisp or Smalltalk (as are the others, by the way). Today, Python is used for everything from throw-away scripts to large scalable web servers that provide uninterrupted service 24x7. It is used for GUI and database programming, client- and server-side web programming, and application testing.

[Python\'s Moratorium - Let\'s Think About This](http://jessenoller.com/2009/12/04/pythons-moratorium-lets-think-about-this/) - Jessenroller.com

Since the news of PEP 3003 being released crossed the 'web -- I've seen more than a handful of assertions and statements made that seemed to grossly miss the point.

I figured I'd expound on my last post to further explain the why of the moratorium and some of the other personal reasons I stepped forward to help author it. [Read More](http://jessenoller.com/2009/12/04/pythons-moratorium-lets-think-about-this/)

[Seamless Neo4j Integration in Django](http://journal.thobe.org/2009/12/seamless-neo4j-integration-in-django.html) - Tobias Ivarsson

About a year ago I gave a presentation at Devoxx where I showed off how easy it was to use any Java library with Django in Jython. The library I demonstrated this with was of course Neo4j. I had written some code for using Neo4j to define models for Django, and now it is ready to be released for you to use it.

[Web2Py Now Works with Jython](http://cargoesktuhoim.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!CDB3AE7AB200E0C!157.entry)

Woah, talking about Nice. Cognizing that they all work together, Jython, Java, Python, and [Web2Py](./Web2Py.html). This opens a broad veriety of features that I could employ web2py for. E.g., I employ Java and Jython at my work. Imagine being able to draw from the same databases and datasources as I wasted my Java application but have a go at it hundredfold faster and easier, and more securely, etc\... all with web2py in Jython.

[Learning New Languages Harmful?](http://michaelkimsal.com/blog/learning-new-languages-harmful/) - Michael Kimsal

After having spent much time with Groovy/Java, and a bit with Ruby and a bit with C#, I have a newer perspective on learning new programming languages. Much of my thoughts are summed up by this post from Gustavo Duartes. I liked his choice of words at the top -- "language dabbling" -- which largely describes my C# and Ruby experience. I've done a little bit in them -- some paid in C#, some not -- but the bulk of my work is in PHP, with a small but growing bit in Grails.

[Benchmarking JSR-223: JRuby, Rhino, Groovy and Jython](http://tiagofernandez.blogspot.com/2009/12/benchmarking-jsr-223-jruby-rhino-groovy.html) - Tiago Fernandez

The idea of this post is to evaluate similar implementations done in Ruby, [JavaScript](JavaScript), Groovy and Python through JSR-223\'s API using the corresponding scripting engines (i.e. JRuby, Rhino, Groovy and Jython).
