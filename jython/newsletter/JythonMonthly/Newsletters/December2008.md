Happy Holidays to Everyone!

We have passed the Christmas season and are about to ring in a new year. It has been an exciting year for Jython and I know that 2009 will be another great one. We have a lot to remember for 2008 as Jython has made some important advances of the past 12 months. To highlight, here are just a few of the great moments for Jython in 2008:

\- Sun Hires Two Key Python Developers - March 2008

\- Jython 2.5 Alpha Released - July 2008

\- Jython 2.5 Beta Released - October 2008

\- Django Runs on Jython - Summer 2008

\- Jim Baker and Leo Soto Presentation of Django on Jython at [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) 2008

\- [PyDev](./PyDev.html) and Netbeans 6.5 Provide Two Great IDEs for Jython Development

Those are just some of the highlights from the past year. I\'m sure that in 2009 we will see a 2.5 release, along with some other Jython surprises\...perhaps Turbo Gears on Jython and other great possibilities!

Onto other fronts, the Jython Podcast homepage is ready. I also have created the first podcast episode, although I would like to call it a beta since the quality has much to be desired. I had my podcasting studio set up and ready to go, but then my good microphone took a turn for the worst and I was left with a cheaper quality microphone for this first recording. You can pick up the podcast at www.jythonpodcast.com if you are interested in hearing episode #1. I hope to purchase a new microphone so that in January we have a top-notch quality broadcast.

As always, I\'d love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Please email me at [jythonpodcast@gmail.com](mailto:jythonpodcast@gmail.com) and let me know if you\'ve got any commentary to add.

Thanks, and have a happy new year!

## Articles 

**Java in the Cloud**

*Author: Hari Gottipati*

No one is talking about the Web 2.0, AJAX, SaaS, or SOA these days. It doesn\'t mean that no one is using these technologies, it is just that these are not the buzzwords anymore. The latest buzzword is \"Cloud Computing\". Every one is talking about building apps in cloud or moving the apps to cloud. There are plenty of jobs on job boards looking for the people with the skills: \"familiarity with cloud\" or \"expertise in cloud\".
