The following text has been derived from the proposed template [CodeOfConduct](CodeOfConduct), to create a PSF-specific variant. It has been submitted to the board as a counter-proposal to considering the CoC in isolation, that deliberately avoids any claims that might be construed as the PSF attempting to police the conduct of the entire Python community, while only being a small part of that community (albeit an influential part through the activities of our members and through the actions of the PSF board).

While I initially proposed this as as \*alternative\* to Brian\'s Code of Conduct, I have instead come around to the viewing it as a \*complement\* to that template: I think we should vote for \*and approve\* both of them, for different purposes. I therefore suggest the following (or similar) motions be presented to the membership as part of the upcoming ballot:

- That the PSF publish a recommended template Code of Conduct (link), as a tool made available to the broader Python community for setting the tone of conferences, mailing lists, user groups, etc. Actual adoption of this code will be up to individual groups within the community.
- That the PSF adopt an explicit Code of Conduct for PSF Members (link), based on the recommended template Code of Conduct, tailored specifically for the PSF. This code will form the basis for future changes to the governance structure of the PSF and the way the PSF conducts its business as we attempt to better align our practices with our ideals.

I believe that presenting two separate motions in this way greatly clarifies the purpose of the template Code of Conduct: my understanding is that it is intended as an \*example\*, something to inspire groups within the Python community when defining what they want \*their\* community to be and definitely \*not\* as a document that claims to speak for the entire Python community as it exists today. The Code of Conduct for PSF Members then serves a dual role as both explicitly declarin the adoption of the code by the PSF, as well as providing an example of a group within the Python community taking the example document and tweaking and tailoring it to make it specific to that group and explicitly adopting it \*as a group\*.

This document was originally titled a \"Statement of Values\" (hence the page title), but after further discussion with the board, I have reverted to the \"Code of Conduct\" terminology to help make the association with the template more clear.

Differences from the template code:

- consistently uses \"we/our\" and avoids \"you/your\" (this really only affected the last sentence of the first paragraph).
- replaces the template\'s lead-in paragraph to the list of attributes with \"Python Software Foundation members are:\"
- in the list of attributes, uses the phrase \"Members of the foundation\" in place of the template\'s \"Members of the Python community\".
- adds one additional paragraph between the open/considerate/respectful bullet points to reflect the PSF\'s desire to promote the code beyond the boundaries of our membership.

# Code of Conduct for Python Software Foundation Members 

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When we're working with members of the community, we aim to follow these guidelines to help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community.

Python Software Foundation members are:

## Open 

- Members of the foundation are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other community members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Considerate 

- Members of the foundation are considerate of their peers \-- other Python users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

## Respectful 

- Members of the foundation are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

In addition to striving to exhibit these traits ourselves, as Python Software Foundation members, we seek to promote and encourage these values throughout the broader Python community.

Overall, we\'re good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. When we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.
