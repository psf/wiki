# Scientific Python Working Group 

*Note:* When creating new wiki pages related to this group, please use wiki subpages, e.g. BylawsWG/Charter.

## Agenda 

This working group shall draw on the expertise of both the PSF and NumFOCUS, and on the broader scientific Python community in general, to select the best use of its budgeted funds to advance the scope, breadth, and utility of Python for scientific work.  In essence, the purpose of the group is to grant funds allocated to it by the PSF towards conferences, user groups, educational, and development efforts.

## Resources 

- As of 24Sep19, the Scientific WG has a yearly budget of \$30,000 USD
