# PSF Fellow Work Group Charter 

## Purpose & Common Goals 

The purpose of this working group is to accept, review, discuss, and vote on new Fellow Member nominations.

## Active Time 

This workgroup will be active indefinitely until the PSF Board decides otherwise.

## Core Values & Internal Government 

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the members in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

## Internal Rules & Guidelines 

- When a nomination is received, it will be posted on [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/FellowNominations](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/FellowNominations)

- Approved Fellow Members will be minuted in the WGs monthly report as well as a monthly announcement to the membership

- New members will be approved if they get 50%+1 of the votes casted

- If/when a particular individual has a conflict of interest they will excuse themselves from any voting.

- When adding new members to the working group, prospective members must send an email to [psf-fellow@python.org](mailto:psf-fellow@python.org) introducing themselves and they must be current PSF Fellow Members.

## Decision Making Policy 

Below is the policy that the PSF Fellow Work Group is currently voting on (August 11, 2017)

### Criteria 

- For those who have served the Python community by creating and/or maintaining various creative contributions, the following statement should be true:
  - \[Nominated Person\] has served the Python community by making available code, tests, documentation, or design, either in a Python implementation or in a Python ecosystem project, that 1) shows technical excellence, 2) is an example of software engineering principles and best practices, and 3) has achieved widespread usage or acclaim.\"
- For those who have served the Python community by coordinating, organizing, teaching, writing, and evangelizing, the following statement should be true:
  - \[Nominated Person\] has served the Python community through extraordinary efforts in organizing Python events, publicly promoting Python, and teaching and coordinating others. \[Nominated Person\]\'s efforts have shown leadership and resulted in long-lasting and substantial gains in the number and quality of Python users, and have been widely recognized as being above and beyond normal volunteering.
- If someone is not accepted to be a fellow in the quarter they were nominated for, they will remain an active nominee for 1 year for future consideration.
- It is suggested/recommended that the nominee have wide Python community involvement. Examples would be (not a complete list - just examples):

- Nominees should be aware of the Python community's Code of Conduct and should have a record of fostering the community.
- Sitting board of directors can be nominated if they meet the above criteria.

In all that this person does, \[Nominated Person\] is an example of what we aspire to be in the Python community.

If it is someone we cannot find context on, we can ask the nominator to provide 3 references from within the community.

## Communication Plan 

The working group will communicate via mailing list ([psf-fellow@python.org](mailto:psf-fellow@python.org)) and via Slack (the-psf.slack.com#psf-fellow). If needed, conference calls or additional communication channels can be set up.
