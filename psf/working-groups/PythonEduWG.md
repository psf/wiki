## PSF Education Work Group 

### Aims: 

The PSF Education Working Group takes global, inclusive, and practical steps to promote education and learning with Python.

By asking what sort of education and learning our community supports, the working group guides decisions that set what sort of community we become. It is through education and learning that we engage with our future colleagues, friends, users, and supporters.

### Strategic Goal: 

Education and learning are core pillars of the PSF\'s mission. As a working group, we seek to guide the strategy to fulfill the [PSF\'s mission](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/) to publicize, promote the adoption of, and facilitate the ongoing development of Python-related technology and educational resources.

### Working group operation and scope: 

As a working group we make things happen. We do this in three ways:

- We\'re a meeting point for people who want to make practical contributions to Python in education.
- We identify and coordinate projects that deliver specific and measurable results that support our aims.
- We support and facilitate such projects so they have the best chance of meeting their goals.

### Current projects for the group: 

These include, but are not limited to:

- Education friendly editor (IDLE)
- Lessons and resources
- A way to communicate, coordinate, and facilitate the educational events that are happening around the world.

### Administration: 

- Chair: TBC

- Co-Chairs:

- [PSF Education WG Charter](PythonEduWGCharter)

### Mailing List: 

To actively participate in these projects, please join the [PythonEdu-WG](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pythonedu-wg) mailing list.

### FAQ: 

#### Q: What is the Python in Education Working Group\'s relationship to the existing Education SIG and the existing Outreach & Education committee? 

A: The PSF Python in Education working group complements, not replaces, existing special interest groups and committees around Python in education.

The [Education SIG](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/) has a long history serving the Python community as an informal mailing list for discussions on education. The [Education SIG mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig) description and its archives give an overview of the broad range of topics discussed in the Education SIG.

The [Outreach & Education committee](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/outreach-and-education)\'s mission is to increase the number of Python users, especially in under-represented demographics.

#### Q: How does the Python in Education Working Group differ from the existing Education SIG and the existing Outreach & Education committee? 

A: The PSF Python in Education Working Group differs from existing groups through its focus on projects. The PSF Python in Education Working Group focuses on identifying, guiding, and supporting specific projects that meet the working group\'s aims and charter.
