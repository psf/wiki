# Working Groups

The PSF uses working groups to get things done. Each group has a charter, a set of members, and a specific area of responsibility. Some of these groups are very active; others are dormant or have completed their original purpose. This page lists all of them, current and historical.

## Active Working Groups

These groups have dedicated wiki sections with charters, meeting notes, and other materials.
