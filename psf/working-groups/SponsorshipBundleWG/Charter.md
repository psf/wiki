# PSF Sponsorship Bundle Working Group Charter 

## Purpose & Common Goals 

The initial purpose of this workgroup is to pick up where we left off for the International Sponsorship Bundle that we created in early 2015. We want to make it easy for companies like Red Hat and Bank of America to provide \"minimal strings attached\" funding globally. Sponsors would only engage more directly when they happen to have a local team interested in driving that engagement directly with the conference organizers.

## Active Time 

This workgroup will be active indefinitely.

## Core Values & Internal Governance 

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

## Rules & Guidelines 

- The initial guideline for this workgroup is for [BetsyWaliszewski](./BetsyWaliszewski.html) to re-create a sponsorship bundle prospectus that includes reasons for all changes/suggestions.

- This new proposal will be discussed on the mailing list.

- The final draft will be decided by the entire workgroup based on majority rule.

- After a final prospectus is in place, the WG will launch the sponsorship options via email.

## Decision Making Procedures 

- Process for coming up with bundles will be proposed to the group
- Sponsorship bundles will be proposed to the group
