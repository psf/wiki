# Scientific Python Working Group Charter 

Also see [ScientificWG](ScientificWG)

## Purpose & Common Goals 

This working group shall draw on the expertise of the broader scientific Python community, to select the best use of its budgeted funds to advance the scope, breadth, and utility of Python for scientific work. In essence, the purpose of the group is to grant funds allocated to it by the PSF towards developer meetings (sprints), project improvements, education, outreach, and workshops/conferences.

## Active Time 

This working group shall stay in existence indefinitely.

## Core Values & Internal Governance 

This working group shall issue public statements at the time that any grants are made by it. These statements shall explain the perceived value and significance of the project(s) to which grants have been given. In the case of conferences or other public events, we may give grants in the form of sponsorships that will increase publicity and public recognition of the PSF (e.g. via have booths, banners, or pamphlets for these groups available at those events as a benefit of sponsorship).

## Rules & Decision Making Procedures 

- Consensus must be reached between all interested members of the committee that are available to respond within 5 days. Explicit consensus is determined, after discussion, via vote (+1 to approve, +0 to abstain, -1 to disapprove). To be funded, a grant must be approved by three members, at least one of whom is a chair, without any explicit disapproval.
- After 5 days (and on or before 14 days), one of the chairs will relay the decision to the PSF board; the PSF Administrator will then forward the decision to the requester and the treasurer, and note it in the board minutes. If the WG fails to reach a decision by two weeks, the request is referred back to the PSF board of directors.
- If there is a joint decision to fund a grant, but the budget is unclear, the co-chairs may decide together on how to proceed.

### Funding guidelines 

- We consider applications that involve Python and science.

- The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

- The working group supports the PSF\'s mission to grow and diversify the international community of Python programmers. As such, **Workshops**, **tutorials**, and **events** seeking grants are encouraged to publish a Code of Conduct/Anti Harassment guide, and to be mindful of diversifying representation during participant selection.

- The PSF will only sponsor **conferences** that have a Code of Conduct/Anti Harassment guide for their conference. The Ada Initiative has a basic template available at [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy).

- For workshops / tutorials, any material generated must be released under an open license that allows modification and re-use, e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA, or CC-0.

### Grant request size guidelines 

- The conference grant size is up to USD 10 per attendee, with the exception of smaller conferences that need extra financial assistance. Example: A conference with 500 attendees can be funded with a grant of up to USD 5000.
- Project improvements are funded according to need, up to 4000 USD.
- Sprints are funded according to need, up to 7,000 USD.
- The educational program grant size is up to USD 25 per student, provided the students each receive at least 6 hours of Python instruction as part of the educational program. The grants workgroup should give preference to students who would otherwise not be able to attend such classes. Example: A workshop with 30 attendees can be funded with a grant of up to USD 750.

Exceptions to these guidelines will be considered only under special circumstances.

### Grantee reporting responsibility 

- For project improvements and sprints, the grantee shall submit a short report (approx. one page) to the Scientific WG no more than one month after the end date of the event, describing the event and detailing successes, challenges, and recommendations to the organizers of future similar events.

### Communication Plan 

The bulk of communication among the working group shall be over the mailing list [scientific@python.org](mailto:scientific@python.org). As needed, we may use other communication means such as video conferencing, phone calls, or in-person meetings.
