Dev mini syncup

14 April 2020

Participants: Paul, Pradyun, Tzu-Ping

\- pip 20.1 + [https://hackmd.io/nSueIf7PQViDeaEPQIuprQ](https://hackmd.io/nSueIf7PQViDeaEPQIuprQ)

- \- What is still missing in the resolver (vs old resolver)

  - TP: If the test suite covers everything, then we\'re missing
    - user installs (may be solved by [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/7997](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/7997))

    - upgrade strategy (need to emit a warning/error for this)

    - constraints (has error message)

    - wheel cache

    - error messages (see below)

    - circular dependency (has error message)
  - Also some things that are failing but I can't figure out why
    - Pradyun: there\'s a lot of stuff that the resolver doesn\'t actually test.

    - \[discussed REQUESTED implementation [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8026/](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8026/)\]

  \- What has been implemented

  - nothing specific to be mentioned in the release notes
  - "If something works, yay, tell us so that we can party, otherwise still tell us so we can fix it"

  \- What to merge

  - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8014](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8014)

  - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8033](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8033)

  - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/labels/C%3A%20new%20resolver](https://github.com/pypa/pip/labels/C%3A%20new%20resolver) \-- there\'s a new label!

  \- Where do users report issues [https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/new-pip-resolver-to-roll-out-this-year.html](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/new-pip-resolver-to-roll-out-this-year.html)

  - zazo? rename & repurpose

  - move issues \-- TP pointed out that we can only use this within the same namespace / org / user repos.

  - Pradyun: don\'t want a temporary repo on the PyPA org.

  - \[TODO 1\]

  \- Release notes + documentation?

  - \- \[TODO 2\]

\- optimising network requests

- Resolvelib will take an iterator in \"highest priority first\" order

- Transition plan, take a list for now with a deprecation warning (and reverse?)

- TP will look at the code and decide what\'s best ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)")

\- error messages [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8033](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8033)

- Pradyun: seems like only 1 failure [https://travis-ci.org/github/pypa/pip/jobs/674789470#L403](https://travis-ci.org/github/pypa/pip/jobs/674789470#L403)

- Paul: will look at that after call.

Pradyun: normalization. ![:(](/wiki/europython/img/sad.png ":(") \* will have to deal w/ in revendoring

[https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PermissionError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PermissionError)

- \[TODO 1\]: Remind Sumana to get us an email address for resolver-related reports as we promised in the PSF blog
- \[TODO 2\]: Discuss w/ Sumana about communication around pip 20.1 + where does she think the notes from Paul should go

Check the above two TODO points with Sumana. Maybe syncup tomorrow (Wed) if there's update on those. Or\... Zulip! :P
