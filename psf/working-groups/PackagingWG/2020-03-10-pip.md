Paul, Pradyun, TP

- State update
  - TP: Just clobbered up something to wire up the resolver into pip CLI. I'm doing this in RequirementCommand (which install, download, and wheel subclass). Sounds about right?

    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/compare/provider-integration\...uranusjr:resolver-switch?expand=1](https://github.com/pypa/pip/compare/provider-integration...uranusjr:resolver-switch?expand=1)

    - What's the process to introduce a new vendored lib into pip?
      - Pradyun: I can write documentation for that! :P

      - Pradyun: Add it to `pyproject.toml`{.backtick} \-- ala `vendoring`{.backtick}

  - Paul: Working on tests for the new resolver objects, and linking the code in with them.
    - What to do about `A->B,C; B->D==version, C->D@url`{.backtick}?

    - If we have a named requirement, name @ url, then when we prepare the URL, we need to check the name matches and error if not.

    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/compare/master\...pfmoore:resolvelib_requirement?expand=1](https://github.com/pypa/pip/compare/master...pfmoore:resolvelib_requirement?expand=1)
- Next steps
  - Paul: Work on requirement/candidate abstraction, assemble the provider, start proposing PRs to master
  - TP: Finish the resolver wrapper, wire up Paul's work after PR proposal, and propose PR for the CLI
  - Pradyun: I need to actually write the docs. Not blocked on anything.
