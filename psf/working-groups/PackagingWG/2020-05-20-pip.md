Dev Meeting on May 19

- Pradyun got 1000+ GH notifications down to \~350-ish.

- Pending PRs
  - Wheel cache
    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8066](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8066)

    - Waiting on Paul\'s review

  - `Resolvelib`{.backtick} 0.4.0 update

    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8267/](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8267/)
- What are we working on next? (this week)
  - \"open pool\":
    - packaging 20.4 is out!
      - normalized name stuff.

    - yanked warning
      - Depends on the wheel cache PR

      - `test_install_yanked_file_and_print_warning`{.backtick}

      - New resolver needs to print a warning when installing a yanked release.

    - resolvelib \-- removing `ResolutionTooDeep`{.backtick} raising logic.

      - we have to figure out what to replace it with, but this is a required step regardless of what other metrics we pick.

    - markers handling
      - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8230](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8230)

    - `local-dir/[extra]`{.backtick}

      - extras + not `SpecifierRequirement`{.backtick}

    - naming!
      - parent vs template
      - ???
  - Pradyun
    - (overflow) Visualizations (dump into examples/vis)
  - Tzu-ping
    - `ResolveLib`{.backtick} 0.4.0

      - Finder cache
        - Always passes a bunch of requirements, to `find_matches`{.backtick}, need to check how caching would work?

        - Provider vs Finder?

        - For experimenting `lru_cache()`{.backtick}

      - Refactor the 150-line `find_matches()`{.backtick} implementation
  - Paul
    - Look at remaining errors in the test suite.
      - Putting down `xfail`{.backtick}s for test suite errors.

      - Mark that they\'re issues, and write `xfail`{.backtick}s.

    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8256](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8256)

    - Constraints
      - URL constraints \-- PEP 508 style URLs feels like it\'d be worth it.
- Later later
  - yanked vs prereleases
    - [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8262](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8262)
