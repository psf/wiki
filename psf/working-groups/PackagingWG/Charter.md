# Purpose & Common Goals 

The purpose of this working group is to support the larger efforts of improving and maintaining the packaging ecosystem in Python through fundraising and disbursement of raised funds. It will largely focus on efforts such as PyPI, pip, packaging.python.org, setuptools, and cross project efforts.

# Active Time 

This workgroup will be active indefinitely at the pleasure of the PSF board.

# Core Values & Internal Government 

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

# Rules & Guidelines 

- When choosing where to allocate funds, the packaging workgroup will take into account primarily what best serves the advancement of packaging in Python, however it should also take into account impact on the wider ecosystem as well.
- If/when a particular individual has a conflict of interest (such as, they are requesting funds for themselves or a company they are affiliated with) they will excuse themselves from any voting.
- The packaging workgroup will not take longer than 2 weeks to discuss and vote on a proposal to disburse funds to a project or effort.
- The packaging workgroup will make the funds raised and spent available to the general public in the form of a Wiki page on the PSF Wiki.
- At any time the PSF board may, at its discretion, add any number of non-voting observers to the working group to observe and participate in discussion.

# Decision Making Procedures 

Decisions on what fundraising and projects/efforts to support will be done using the voting procedures outlined below. Anyone may propose or request funding for a specific project/effort to be considered by the WG by emailing their proposal to [packaging-wg@python.org](mailto:packaging-wg@python.org). It is recommended, but not required, for anyone with a proposal to find a champion among the voting members prior to submitting their proposal.

In general, projects/efforts funded should follow these guidelines:

- Improve or maintain the state of Python\'s packaging effort by some noticeable or measurable amount.
- Have at least rough consensus/agreement from the owners of whatever project is being touched (e.g. don\'t spend money on something a project doesn\'t want) or general agreement from distutils-sig for cross project efforts (ideally in the form of an accepted PEP).
- The project in question being under the PyPA banner is recommended, but not required for funding.

When adding new members to the working group, prospective members must send an email to [packaging-wg@python.org](mailto:packaging-wg@python.org) introducing themselves along with a description of why they want to be a member and what they bring to the process. Approval of new members will be decided using the voting procedures detailed below.

## Voting 

A vote for any proposal will last for 5 days, or when all voting members have voted, whichever comes first. For a proposal to be successful it must have at least two +1\'s, more +1\'s than -0\'s, and no -1. Voting should generally be done using the mailing list, but may be done in any venue given agreement of all voting members.

# Communication Plan 

The working group will communicate via mailing list ([packaging-wg@python.org](mailto:packaging-wg@python.org)) and via Slack (the-psf.slack.com#packaging-wg). If needed, conference calls or additional communication channels can be set up.

# Budget 

The working group budget will be whatever funds that the working group has raised for itself. If needed, the working group may ask the board of directors for additional funding. The working group will display the funds gathered on our main wiki page: [https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG). We will also list the funds that are spent. Details of contracts (when applicable) will be shared with the board.
