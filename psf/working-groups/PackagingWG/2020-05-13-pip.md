Participants:

- Nicole
- Pradyun

Agenda:

- discuss pip output
- discuss documentation issues

The UX team would like to understand the way that we can improve the output of pip \*in general\*, to support the new resolver error and information messages.

Nicole asked Pradyun whether or not there is a list of all of the messages that are currently output to the terminal - answer is no, \*however\*, we can find these by searching for `logger`{.backtick} messages in the codebase.

pip uses logging from the standard library - levels can be viewed here: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels)

We discussed the verbosity levels as a useful tool for users to control what output they want to see. Pradyun has the feeling that the verbosity levels are not useful / not used in their current state.

Next steps:

- Put together a document listing all current messages, so we have an overview of all information presented to the user

- Consider what information is \*not\* displayed that could be exposed to the user

- See [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4649](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4649)

We also discussed documentation. It is fair to say that the UX team has found it a challenge to get onboarded on this project, partially because the documentation about Python packaging is spread all over the internet, e.g.

- Packaging.python.org
- Documentation for each project (pip, warehouse, twine, etc, etc)
- third party blog posts, videos, etc.

Next steps:

- Nicole to include this point in UX recommendations
