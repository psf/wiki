Ilan / Pradyun meeting (Getting the ball rolling!)

March 28, 2020

- Filed the first PR!

- What functionality do we need, as a person writing these tests
  - Selecting tests (based on resolver, based on YAML, based on file?)
  - Skipping tests based on which resolver they\'re running with
  - Error messages
  - Ability to pass options

- \* What do want do with the tests (running, writing etc)
  - Maintain the current format; while extending it
    - to allow passing options
    - to allow state to propagate (it already does? yes)
  - Better error checking + reporting

- \* We won\'t make these non-Python tests from pytest\'s perspective (pytest has functionality for this: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/nonpython.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/nonpython.html))

  - Ilan: Thinking of adding a new module, and experimenting with the testing and, yea, then think about how this new module can\... you know do the old & new tests

  - Pradyun: don\'t be wary of modifying these existing files

- Looking at the code
  - (yay! only 200 LoC!)

- \[on tests\]
  - How tests are skipped
  - How installations are done
  - How processing happens
    - How each case is run
    - State passed within a test

<!-- -->

- Pradyun: Can run generate_yaml_tests directly, to see what the output of that is!
- Pradyun: Can run tests and print the inputs to each tests as well!

Take aways: Ilan will spend some time to get more familiar with the code: \"have a good overview of the current state and where we want to be\"
