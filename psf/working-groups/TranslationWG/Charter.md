# PSF Translation Workgroup Charter 

## Purpose & Common Goals 

The initial purpose of this workgroup, as inspired by [PEP545](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0545/) and other translation efforts, is to support and encourage the translation of PSF documents and Python documentation generally into languages other than English as needed by various Python communities world-wide. The key role of this work group, at least initially, will be to identify priorities and infrastructure needed to support translations, and to coordinate efforts of various communities to contribute translations.

## Active Time 

This workgroup will be active indefinitely at the pleasure of the PSF board.

## Core Values & Internal Governmence 

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

### Membership 

Membership should include native speakers of major languages other than English, particularly (but not exclusively) including Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese. This is not a limitation and speakers of other languages are encouraged.

Membership will be open to anyone who is interested in the translation of PSF materials and Python documentation. Majority consensus will approve members.

## Rules & Guidelines 

- Any rules and guidelines will be voted upon by the working group as needed. The working group is ultimately under the oversight of the PSF board and any disputes or unresolved issues may be referred to the board for a decision.

## Decision Making Procedures 

- Decisions will be made by majority vote on the mailing list
- Discussion of projects/proposals will also occur on the mailing list

## Communication Plan 

The team will communicate via mailing list - [translation@python.org](mailto:translation@python.org). If needed, conference calls can be set up.

## Budget 

- None proposed at this time, but may be needed in the future.
