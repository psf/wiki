# PSF Jobs Working Group Charter 

*Note:* This page is readable without login.

## Purpose & Common Goals 

- This working group shall review job board listings and give usability feedback to the PSF\'s Infrastructure Director.
- The goal is to emphasize the importance of continued longevity for Python by providing a place for job seekers and employers to find the right fit for Python-specific jobs. The jobs board is part of our service to the Python community - to companies providing the jobs and to the Python developers looking for jobs.

## Active Time 

This working group shall stay in existence indefinitely.

## Core Values & Internal Governance 

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

Prospective members must send an email to [jobs@python.org](mailto:jobs@python.org) introducing themselves. They must be current PSF Members. The WG team will approve new members. Members should be willing to commit to a minimum of 5 hours a month.
