Ilan / Pradyun Syncup

April 4, 2020

- Ilan: I added ability to pass options in the YAML tests
- Ilan: Trying to get it working with new resolver; still seeing errors.
  - Pradyun + Ilan: working together to figure out \*why\* the failures happen
  - Figured it out! \[happy face\]
- Discussed:
  - Changing certain verbs/words in the YAML format to be nicer
  - Adding the ability to add the tests w/ different markers
