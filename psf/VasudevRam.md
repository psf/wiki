### Skills and experience {#Skills_and_experience}

- Python, Ruby, Java, C, UNIX and Linux, relational databases, multiple open source technologies, libraries and tools are some of the areas I\'ve worked on a good amount. Have worked with UNIX from before Linux was first created, and with open source software from before the term \"open source\" was coined at the first O\'Reilly Open Source Summit. Apart from the technologies mentioned above, I also like to explore various new languages, tools and libraries that seem to be interesting or have potential, and I do that on an ongoing basis.
- I also have technical leadership and software project management experience. Have led and managed small teams of developers on different projects.

I\'m always interested in, and on the lookout for, opportunities for possible collaboration with technical and business people, for fun, learning and profit. So I welcome all genuine inquiries for possible software contract or consulting work, training work, or just plain networking with a view to any possible future collaboration.
