## Purpose & Common Goals {#Purpose_.26_Common_Goals}

The initial purpose of this workgroup is to pick up where we left off for the International Sponsorship Bundle that we created in early 2015. We want to make it easy for companies like Red Hat and Bank of America to provide \"minimal strings attached\" funding globally. Sponsors would only engage more directly when they happen to have a local team interested in driving that engagement directly with the conference organizers.

## Active Time {#Active_Time}

This workgroup will be active indefinitely.

## Core Values & Internal Governance {#Core_Values_.26_Internal_Governance}

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the PSF Code of Conduct ([https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/){.https}). Any actions (found by a majority) made against the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in the acting person being removed from the workgroup.

## Rules & Guidelines {#Rules_.26_Guidelines}

- The initial guideline for this workgroup is for [BetsyWaliszewski](./BetsyWaliszewski.html){.nonexistent} to re-create a sponsorship bundle prospectus that includes reasons for all changes/suggestions.

- This new proposal will be discussed on the mailing list.

- The final draft will be decided by the entire workgroup based on majority rule.

- After a final prospectus is in place, the WG will launch the sponsorship options via email.

## Decision Making Procedures {#Decision_Making_Procedures}

- Process for coming up with bundles will be proposed to the group
- Sponsorship bundles will be proposed to the group
- Process for how invoicing will work and payment disbursement

- Amendments to the prospectus will be decided by a majority rule
- The team will vote on the proposed bundles. Decisions will be made by a majority rule.

- The WG will maintain this process for as long as the "product" is viable to our community and the PSF

## Communication Plan {#Communication_Plan}
