# PSF Conference Kit 

## Regional Conference Kits 

The PSF has several large conference kits which can be used to present the PSF at local conferences to easily setup a professional PSF booth.

The kits are made available in these regions (see below for more details):

- Europe
- North America
- South America

Creating the kits was a joined effort by Armin Stross-Radschinski and Marc-Andre Lemburg in 2012. Please contact [MarcAndreLemburg](MarcAndreLemburg) for questions regarding the kits.

### Kit contents 

Each kit contains:

- A **foldable display** as background and eye-catcher. Measurements: width: 225cm, height: 226cm, depth: 30cm. The display also includes two lamps which can be used when setting up the display inside a hall or building.

- Two cocktail/bistro **table slip covers** for round tables. Measurements of the tables: diameter: 60-80cm, height: 100-110cm. The slip covers use stretch cloth, so they can be made to fit many different table size. Please handle gently, so that they don\'t tear. If you don\'t have suitable cocktail tables available, you can rent them from a local party service or the hotel. Please arrange with [MarcAndreLemburg](MarcAndreLemburg) to get the rental costs refunded.

- Setup instructions These are included on paper. If missing, please print out the PDF from the next section and readd.

The kits are packaged in a black sports trolley bag with measurements roughly 100x40x40cm. Each kit weighs about 17kg, which leaves room for extra marketing material up to the usual 20kg limit for baggage on a plane.

### Ordering more large conference kits 

The kits were ordered from the German vendor [Flyeralarm](http://flyeralarm.de) using the PDF [Large-PSF-Display-Flyeralarm.pdf](attachments/PSF(20)Conference(20)Kit/Large-PSF-Display-Flyeralarm.pdf) for the display and the PDF [PSF-Round-Table-Cloth-Flyeralarm.pdf](attachments/PSF(20)Conference(20)Kit/PSF-Round-Table-Cloth-Flyeralarm.pdf) for the cocktail table slip covers.

### Setup instructions for the kit 

Please follow these instructions when setting up or taking down the kit:

- [PSF Conference Kit Setup (PDF)](attachments/PSF(20)Conference(20)Kit/PSF-Conference-Kit-Setup-Instructions.pdf "PSF Conference Kit Setup (PDF)")

Care has to be taken when doing this, since we would like to reuse the kit for a while, if possible.

When preparing the kit for travel or shipping, please make sure that the original packaging equipment is used. This makes it less likely that something get damaged.

If something does get damaged, please inform [MarcAndreLemburg](MarcAndreLemburg). It may be possible to send replacement material.

## Carry-on Kits 

The regional kits are not always easy to ship to conferences and since we only have one such kit per region, scheduling shipments, etc. may also result in problems getting the kit to the conferences on time.

In order to be more flexible, we\'re currently investigating having several smaller L-display kits available. These are kits which only weigh 3-4kg and come with a carry-on bag to easily take to conferences on plane, car, train, etc.

To test drive the setup, we\'ve created one such kit for [PyCon](./PyCon.html) ZA 2012, which Ewa has attended. Turns out, the kit is easy to use and can be taken on a plane without problems.

![width=200](attachments/PSF(20)Conference(20)Kit/pic3.jpg "width=200")

The kits were created by Marc-Andre Lemburg based on the design of the larger display. Please contact [MarcAndreLemburg](MarcAndreLemburg) for questions regarding the kits. They cost around EUR 65-70 each.

### Available Carry-on Kits 

The following members have carry-on kits:

- Ewa Jodlowska \< [jodlowska2@gmail.com](mailto:jodlowska2@gmail.com) \> - 1 kit

  - \- 2015-01-30: Took the two kits to FOSDEM 2015 and left them with Stéphane.

    \- 2015-01-08: I\'ve ordered two kids for use at PythonFOSDEM (which Stéphane organizes) and will leave the kits with him to use at [PyCon](./PyCon.html) FR and (the new) [PyCon](./PyCon.html) Belgium.

### Ordering more carry-on kits

## Common questions asked at the booth 

TBD

## Getting the kits through customs 

In most cases, there are no duties to pay, so customs is usually not much of a problem. If not, customs may ask you for a Customs Tariffs Number (CN number) or Harmonized System (HS) number for each of the goods.

These are the numbers I found that match the things in the regional kit (there are certainly other classifications possible as well, but I\'m no expert on those):

### Stickers and flyers 

- 4911.10.90 - Trade advertising material, commercial catalogs and the like / Other

### Display 

If focus is placed on the printed display cloth:

- 7609.00.00.90 - Aluminium tube or pipe fittings (for example, couplings, elbows, sleeves)

If focus is placed on the aluminum display frame:

- 5407.54 - Woven fabrics of synthetic filament yarn, including woven fabrics obtained from materials of heading / Printed

### Table cloth 

- 5407.54 - Woven fabrics of synthetic filament yarn, including woven fabrics obtained from materials of heading / Printed

### Customs duties and VAT 

Customs duties are usually between 0-8% of the customs value. The latter can be estimated and since all of the kits are used materials, should sum up to around USD 300-500.

If customs needs some kind of invoice, the PSF can create a pro-forma invoice with PSF letterhead, outlining the figures.

In rare cases, import VAT will also apply. The percentage and procedure depends on the country of destination. Since the kits will usually only be used for a single event, VAT will be refunded when exporting the kit again and so can often be avoided altogether by filling out some forms (customs will likely have those available).
