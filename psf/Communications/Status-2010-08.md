### Continued Activities from Last Month

1.  Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.

    A few volunteers have expressed interest, but things are getting off to a slow start. I hope to have some more interesting topics to give them after the August Board meeting.

2.  Infrastructure Committee blog post

    Sean as chairman; other members; planned improvements; python.org updates. I was able to collect a pretty good list of names for the webmasters and postmasters, so I\'m including some details about those teams as well.

    Describe what it is, how to add a job, etc. I\'ll mention the maintainer(s) as well. Martin Thomas has provided some interesting statistics about the number of posts, etc. that I\'ll work in.
