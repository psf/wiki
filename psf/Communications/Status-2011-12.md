### Ongoing Projects

1.  Boston Python Workshop Grant post by Jessica McKellar

    [http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/11/boston-python-workshop-psf-grant.html](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/11/boston-python-workshop-psf-grant.html){.http .reference .external}

2.  Brian Curtin is working on a post about the video equipment purchased by the PSF and how it has been used to record conference talks and other events.

3.  Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.

    A few volunteers have expressed interest, but things are getting off to a slow start. I hope to have some more interesting topics to give them after the August Board meeting.

4.  Mike Driscoll is working on a retrospective post summarizing all of the funding we have provided for conferences over the last year. We will wait to publish until closer to the end of 2011.

5.  We have initiated a transition plan so Brian Curtin can take over as Communications Director around the time of the next Board elections after PyCon 2012.
