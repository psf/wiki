### Purpose of this wiki

The purpose of this wiki is as a space for collaborative editing:

- to manage PSF working groups;
- for initial internal development of proposals and plans, that may not yet be ready to be shared with the world at large;
- to arrive at an internal consensus before taking an official position;
- for sensitive and confidential information; and
- to serve as an archive of projects we decided not to pursue and the reasons why not.
