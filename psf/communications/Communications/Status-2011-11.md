### Ongoing Projects

1.  Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.

    A few volunteers have expressed interest, but things are getting off to a slow start. I hope to have some more interesting topics to give them after the August Board meeting.

2.  Mike Driscoll is working on a retrospective post summarizing all of the funding we have provided for conferences over the last year. We will wait to publish until closer to the end of 2011.

3.  Begin transition plan so Brian Curtin can take over as Communications Director around the time of the next Board elections after PyCon 2012.

### Tabled Activities

1.  PyCon video equipment loan/rental program post

    There was some discussion of offering the PyCon video equipment to PUGs for their meetings, but the mechanism to do it isn\'t in place, yet.
