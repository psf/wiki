2.  Announce grant to fund Python Miro Community (post scheduled for 21 March).
3.  We are starting a new project in partnership with the python-dev team to blog about the volunteer efforts from that group. I was able to recruit a few contributors at PyCon, and will put out a more general call for help after we have the blog established.

### Tabled Activities

1.  We missed our window of opportunity to write about the new PyCon web site. We\'ll pick it up right after the conference, when the people we need to interview aren\'t as busy. Engelbert Gruber has prepared interview questions for the post.
