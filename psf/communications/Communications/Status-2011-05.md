2.  \"Python Insider\" blog translations.

    Since we announced the Spanish and Japanese translations, close to 30 volunteers have stepped forward to translate the Python Insider blog into other languages. In addition to the original two translations, we now have teams working on Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Romanian, and German. Persian and Russian volunteers just joined and are setting up the tools. We have added links to all of the available translations in the sidebar on [http://blog.python.org/](http://blog.python.org/).
