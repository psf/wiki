3.  Added RuPy promotion to the python.org front page and posted on twitter.

4.  We missed the window to publish a few announcements of funding for conferences that have already passed. Mike Driscoll is working on a retrospective post summarizing all of the funding we have provided for conferences over the last year. We will wait to publish until closer to the end of 2011.

### Ongoing Projects

1.  Post about common trademark use.

    *No progress*

2.  Interviews with GSoC students.

    I don\'t have enough staff or personal time to do this, so I think we\'re going to have to pass again this year. If the GSoC mentors or students want to write up anything about their projects, we can publish the details on the blog (or link to them elsewhere).

2.  Paulo Nuin is working on a post about the PyPI mirroring project.
