3.  Launched \"Python Insider\" blog.

    We started a new blogging project in partnership with the python-dev team to publicize the volunteer efforts from that group. See [http://blog.python.org/](http://blog.python.org/) for the results.

    After recruiting a few contributors at PyCon (Anthony Scopatz, Paul Moore, and Brian Curtin), the project had good momentum. We started by creating a list of topics and a backlog of \"easy\" material to publish to keep the schedule relatively full (the \"Meet the Team\" series of mini-interviews). Several core developers have also signed up to write posts on their own, and we have had at least one substantive post per week since the blog launched.

    The blog design was contributed by Marcin Wojtczuk. It includes a blogroll linking to posts on the blogs for individual developers.

    After the launch, I handed over management of the project to Brian Curtin. As lead blogger, Brian will triage and schedule topics and take care of the administrative work of keeping the blog running week-to-week. I will continue to act as an advisor.

    The next major project for Python Insider is establishing Spanish and Japanese translation sites. Translators for both languages have already stepped forward, so we just need to set up the actual blogging software and DNS entries. Other translations are welcome, so if anyone wants to volunteer please have them contact me.

    I don\'t plan to include detailed information about Python Insider in the Communications team status report every month (I won\'t link to every post, as I do for the Foundation blog), but I will provide highlights of significant projects and work.
