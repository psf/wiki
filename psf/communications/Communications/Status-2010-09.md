### Continued Activities from Last Month

1.  Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.

    All of the posts last month were written by other volunteers. We\'ve worked out the kinks in the review and editing process, and I expect future updates to flow more smoothly.

2.  Job board blog post

3.  Send announcement email about the blog to various mailing lists (c.l.py, c.l.py.announce, etc.).

    Mike Driscoll sent email to both lists on Sept 7.

### Planned for Next Month

1.  Mike Driscoll is trying to put together some information about our GSoC project(s), but reports that the details available online are incomplete. He is working with Arc Riley and other mentors to pull together more information.
2.  Paulo Nuin is working on a post about the PyPI mirroring project.

### Ongoing Projects

The Twitter team is fully self-sufficient at this point. I don\'t think I\'ve posted anything in the last month. If you spot something you think should go out via Twitter, direct it to \@ThePSF and the team will pick it up.

1.  PyCon video equipment loan/rental program post

    There was some discussion of offering the PyCon video equipment to PUGs for their meetings, but the mechanism to do it isn\'t in place, yet.
