### Continued Activities from Last Month

1.  Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.

    A few volunteers have expressed interest, but things are getting off to a slow start. I hope to have some more interesting topics to give them after the August Board meeting.

2.  Infrastructure Committee blog post

    Sean as chairman; other members; planned improvements; python.org updates. I was able to collect a pretty good list of names for the webmasters and postmasters, so I\'m including some details about those teams as well.

4.  Job board blog post

    Describe what it is, how to add a job, etc. I\'ll mention the maintainer(s) as well. Martin Thomas has provided some interesting statistics about the number of posts, etc. that I\'ll work in.
