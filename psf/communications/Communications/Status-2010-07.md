5.  Twitter account

    Announced it on the blog 24 June [http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/connect-with-psf-on-twitter.html](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/connect-with-psf-on-twitter.html)

    Followed 11 project, 45 user groups, and 15 conference accounts.

    Recruited a team of 5 volunteers to keep up with the messages being followed and re-tweet interesting announcements (major releases, conference deadlines, etc.). They are also working on finding other accounts to follow.

6.  PyCon 2011 leadership blog post

    Posted 28 June: [http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/leadership-for-pycon-us-2011.html](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/leadership-for-pycon-us-2011.html)

7.  Added Brad Allen to the PyCon blog so he could post about PyTexas.

8.  Sent email to PSF members list soliciting nominations for Frank Willison Award.

9.  Converted the comments on the blog to use Disqus ([http://disqus.com/](http://disqus.com/)), since it has better moderation tools.

10. \"What do you want to know?\" post

> Posted 1 July: [http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/what-do-you-want-to-know-about-psf.html](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/what-do-you-want-to-know-about-psf.html)
>
> Solicits feedback from the blog readers about what sorts of posts I should write.
>
> There were a few good questions about funding/sponsorship that I was able to answer myself, and at least one other that may turn into a topic for a future post. I suggest we put together a single page on the web site with all of the ways the PSF offers funding to individuals and groups. Even if this new page is simply a list of links to other pages with details, having the single page to refer to will help.

11. Set up a private hg repository on BitBucket for the Python Pulse newsletter. I\'ve given other known contributors administrative access to it.

12. Montréal-Python sprint post

    Publicity for pilot project for the sprint committee.

    Posted 4 July: [http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/montreal-python-packaging-sprint.html](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/montreal-python-packaging-sprint.html)

### Planned for July

1.  Infrastructure Committee blog post

    Sean as chairman; other members; planned improvements; python.org updates. I was able to collect a pretty good list of names for the webmasters and postmasters, so I\'m including some details about those teams as well.

    Post will go live 12 July

2.  Job board blog post

    Describe what it is, how to add a job, etc. I\'ll mention the maintainer(s) as well. Martin Thomas has provided some interesting statistics about the number of posts, etc. that I\'ll work in.

3.  Research the project to fund work on the email module and write about it.

4.  Write about the user group news blog ([http://python-groups.blogspot.com/](http://python-groups.blogspot.com/)) and encourage more groups to publish information about their meetings.

5.  Start recruiting other people to help with writing for the blog.
