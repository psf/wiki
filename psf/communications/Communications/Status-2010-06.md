### Completed Activities

1.  Set up the PSF blog ([http://pyfound.blogspot.com/](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/)) to be used as a reliable means of communicating with members. It now includes Feedburner support, giving us RSS/Atom as well as email distribution. It is connected to the Twitter account ([http://twitter.com/ThePSF](http://twitter.com/ThePSF)) so that new posts are automatically published there as well.
2.  Posts published:

3.  Discussed marketing brochure(s) with Marc-Andre. He is going to work directly with his contact in Germany, with input but not a lot of direct involvement from me.

### Planned Activities

1.  Establish a Facebook page and connect it to the blog as well.

2.  Posts to write:

    Board Offers
    :   Names and responsibilities.

    Infrastructure Committee
    :   Sean as chairman; other members; recusal agreement; planned improvements; python.org updates

    Trademarks Committee
    :   David as chairman; other members; responsibilities

    PyCon 2010 Report
    :   Final attendance numbers; financial aid granted (not by name, just totals); sprint outcome; anything we know we will do differently next year

### Feedback Needed

1.  Are there any other social networks or tools I should be investigating as communication channels? I looked into LinkedIn, but it isn\'t clear that this sort of news would be welcome in the existing Python Community group (and I\'m not sure there\'s a way to publish automatically).
2.  Does the vote on Exoweb sponsor membership from the May meeting warrant a post? It would be a good excuse to talk about how other companies can become sponsors, but I can do that without mentioning Exoweb directly.
3.  So far I have been writing posts based on the Board meeting minutes. If there are topics you think I should write about that aren\'t covered in the minutes, let me know.
