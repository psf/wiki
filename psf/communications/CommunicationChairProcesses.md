# PSF Communication Chair Processes 

## Sending minutes and blog posts to members 

The meeting minutes from a board meeting are made public approximately 2 weeks after the meeting. One of the communication chairs could send a message to the psf-community & psf-board-public lists, letting our membership know when new meeting minutes are made public. And also point to any new blog posts, etc.

Here\'s an example:

## Sending blog post ideas to blog team 

Historically this is the communication chairs\' role. Once they see a good report come through that has a lot of substance for a blog, the report is passed onto the blog team. The blog team has their own mailing list. [psf-blog@python.org](mailto:psf-blog@python.org). It is a good idea for chairs to join this list and to introduce themselves to the blog writers. [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-blog](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-blog). If any director would like to write a blog from time to time, they are welcome to! We can set them up on blogger to post.
