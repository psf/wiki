## Zeth {#Zeth-1}

Hello, I am Zeth, I live in Birmingham, UK.

I am one of the organisers of PyConUK and between 2008-2010 have been one of the organisers of [EuroPython](./EuroPython.html){.nonexistent}. Also to be found at Python West Midlands which I founded.

As well as Python, I like Linux, and XML and renovating my little house. Come and have a beer or a cup of tea with me sometime.

I work for Universities in UK and Germany, as well as a tiny bit of work for private companies when I can get it.
