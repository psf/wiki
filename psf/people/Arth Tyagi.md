# Arth Tyagi 

Email: `<ceo AT arisveam DOT com>`

I founded a startup to build open-source ML applications when I was 16 last year. Right now, I am a high school senior, developer, blogger and occasionally composing music for fun. I am developing my own Tor Client in Python and also an improved open-source tool similar to Nyx for monitoring Tor connections with a beautiful GUI as a localhost web application. Also planning on building an ed-tech platform with Django as the core technology to help people to learn code.

Working on the Nyx module of the Tor Project. Nyx is a command-line monitor for Tor. With this, you can get detailed real-time information about your relay such as bandwidth usage, connections, logs, and much more. Also working on my own Python Tor Client as a project for learning Stem ( one of [TorProject](./TorProject.html)\'s modules) and then working on the development of Stem. I also set up an onion site ( Tor Hidden service ) at [http://sfsy46kftauutax527aiep5xkx2kzhc64dxjj2ky2lp7z72tk4ydxyid.onion/](http://sfsy46kftauutax527aiep5xkx2kzhc64dxjj2ky2lp7z72tk4ydxyid.onion/)
