The Project Funding Working Group is a volunteer [work group of the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#project-funding-work-group){.https}.

## Purpose {#Purpose}

This Working Group researches, and advises Python community volunteers on applying for external grants and similar funding to advance the mission of the PSF, which includes, but is not limited to, things such as advancing the Python core, Python-related infrastructure, key Python projects, and Python education and awareness. Read the [charter](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG/Charter){.https} for more about the Work Group\'s purpose and goals.
