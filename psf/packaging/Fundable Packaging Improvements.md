# Packaging improvements that could be funded 

The [Fundable Packaging Improvements repository](https://github.com/psf/fundable-packaging-improvements) lists specific things that

1.  the Python packaging community wants

2.  are fairly well-scoped

3.  would happen much faster if the [Packaging Working Group](PackagingWG) got funding to achieve them (through [donations](http://donate.pypi.org/) or grants/directed gifts)

That list [was previously on this wiki page](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Fundable%20Packaging%20Improvements?action=info) and has now been moved [to GitHub](https://github.com/psf/fundable-packaging-improvements).

Please contact the Packaging WG to ask us to estimate how much one of these improvements would cost; we\'ll get back to you within a few business days.
