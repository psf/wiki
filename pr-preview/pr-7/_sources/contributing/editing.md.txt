# Editing Wiki Pages

### On GitHub

The most straightforward path. Every wiki page is a `.md` file under one of three directories:

- `python/` -- the main Python wiki (3,274 pages)
- `psf/` -- Python Software Foundation governance and programs (378 pages)
- `jython/` -- Jython, the JVM implementation (433 pages)

Find the file you want to change, edit it, and open a pull request. GitHub's web editor works fine for quick fixes. For anything more involved, clone the repo and work locally (see [Local Development](development.md) for setup instructions).

Pages use MyST Markdown, which is standard Markdown plus a handful of Sphinx directives. You can use `{admonition}`, `{toctree}`, `{grid}`, code blocks, tables -- all the usual stuff. The [MyST docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html) cover the full syntax.

#### Adding a new page

1. Create a `.md` file in the right directory. Start it with a top-level heading (`# Page Title`).
2. Add the filename (without `.md`) to the `{toctree}` in the parent `index.md`.

If you're making a new subdirectory, put an `index.md` inside it with its own toctree, then reference `subdir/index` from the parent.

#### Page format

Pages migrated from MoinMoin have a legacy notice at the top. You can remove it if you're substantially rewriting the content. New pages don't need one.

A minimal page looks like:

```markdown
## My Page Title

Content goes here. Standard Markdown works -- links, lists, code blocks, tables.

Use [MyST directives](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html)
when you need admonitions, toctrees, or tab panels.
```

#### What about redirects?

The old MoinMoin wiki encoded special characters in URLs in its own way -- spaces became `(20)`, slashes became `(2f)`, German umlauts like `Ä` became `(c384)`. All 5,400+ redirects from old URLs to new paths live in `_redirects.json`.

If you move or rename a page, add an entry there so existing links don't break. You can regenerate the full redirect map with:

```bash
make redirects
```

### On GitHub with CMS

For people who'd rather not touch Git directly, there's a browser-based editor at `/admin/` on the live site. It's powered by [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) (the maintained fork of Netlify CMS).

You log in with your GitHub account, pick a page from any of the three wiki sections, edit it in a rich-text-ish Markdown editor, and save. Behind the scenes, Decap CMS creates a branch and pull request on your behalf. The editorial workflow means your changes go through review before merging, same as any other PR.

The CMS configuration lives in `_extra/admin/config.yml`. It defines three collections (one per wiki section) and uses `open_authoring`, which means anyone with a GitHub account can propose edits -- they don't need write access to the repo.

### Without GitHub

:::{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

We're looking into options for allowing edits without requiring a GitHub account at all. The current CMS flow and the standard PR workflow both need one. If you have content to contribute but no GitHub account, reach out to the PSF or open an issue and we'll figure something out.
