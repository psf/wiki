Mason is always a beacon of transparency, and leads by example both in assisting other organizations and conferences with his and [PyTexas](./PyTexas.html)\' organzers\' experience and nurturing and encouraging prospective conference attendees and speakers. Thus, Mason\'s work shines beyond [PyTexas](./PyTexas.html) and extends to the international Python and technical conference community at large.

#### Sahil Rajendra Pardeshi 

I, Mrunal Kumavat, would like to nominate Sahil Rajendra Pardeshi for recognition as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Sahil has made significant contributions to the Python ecosystem through the development and maintenance of widely used open-source libraries:

- Concurra -- A structured concurrency framework that builds upon Python's native threading and multiprocessing modules, offering advanced dependency handling and scalable task execution for network automation and large-scale testing workflows.

  🔗 [https://pypi.org/project/concurra/](https://pypi.org/project/concurra/) parallel-execute -- A lightweight parallel execution library with 425K+ downloads, simplifying task orchestration and concurrency for Python developers worldwide.

  🔗 [https://pypi.org/project/parallel-execute/](https://pypi.org/project/parallel-execute/)

Both libraries demonstrate technical excellence, adherence to software engineering best practices, and have achieved widespread adoption in the Python community, positively impacting developers across diverse domains.

In addition to his engineering contributions, Sahil actively supports the Python community by sharing knowledge through technical blogs, open-source collaboration, and promoting best practices in concurrent programming for Python applications.

Given the impact and scale of his contributions, I believe Sahil meets the PSF Fellow criteria for extraordinary efforts in advancing the Python ecosystem.

#### Sidhartha Velishala 

I am writing to self-nominate for the Python Software Foundation (PSF) Fellow membership. As an active contributor and advocate for Python in the [DevOps](./DevOps.html) space, I believe my work aligns well with the values and mission of the PSF.

I am deeply committed to the Python ecosystem and would be honored to be considered for the PSF Fellow membership. Please let me know if any additional details or references are needed.

#### Stan Ulbrych 

I, Norbert Lewandowski, nominate Stan Ulbrych to be a PSF Fellow. This is because of his work in Polish community and specifically translation of documentation. Personnally, when I made quite a mess of the translation he messaged me and explained what I had done wrong but encouraged me to keep translating. Though I know it must have taken a while to fix all of the errors I added. Because of him I got some friends to join and he was always happy to anwer questions. He comaintains the translation reposiotory and transifex management which for many translators (2.03K per [https://explore.transifex.com/python-doc/python-newest/](https://explore.transifex.com/python-doc/python-newest/)) to work on the translation!

#### William Vincent 

*Selected in Q3 of 2025*

I, Carlton Gibson (PSF Fellow since 2022), propose that William Vincent be recognized as a Fellow of the PSF due to his significant contributions to the Python and Django communities. He is one of the leading tech educators through his three books now in their fifth editions (Django for Beginners/APIs/Professionals), podcast (Django Chat, which I have co-hosted with him since 2019, in full disclosure), newsletter (Django News, weekly since 2019), and [LearnDjango](./LearnDjango.html).com website stuffed with free tutorials and content.

He is also active in the community itself, serving on the Django Software Foundation board from 2020-2022, where he led the launch of the now-annual Django Survey, regularly speaks at [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) US and [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) Europe conferences, including a keynote this year in Dublin. And since January he is a Python Developer Advocate at [JetBrains](./JetBrains.html), where is making further efforts on behalf of the community.

### 2025 Q2 Nominations 

#### Becky & Mark Smith 

*Mark Smith Selected in Q2 of 2025* *Becky Smith Selected in Q3 of 2025*

I, Hynek Schlawack, would like to nominate Becky and Mark Smith (aka judy2k) as fellows of the PSF.

Both have been active members of the Python community for at least a decade, but mostly silently in the background. They've run at least one [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) Europe: [https://2023.djangocon.eu/organisers/](https://2023.djangocon.eu/organisers/) been involved in the Edinburgh edition of [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) and are now running [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) UK after taking over the chair: [https://2025.pyconuk.org/contact/](https://2025.pyconuk.org/contact/) As I have witnessed first-hand, they were heavily involved in earlier editions too.

Both have also been involved in outreach activities like [DjangoGirls](./DjangoGirls.html) workshops. Becky has even founded [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) Edinburgh and [DjangoGirls](./DjangoGirls.html) Edinburgh: [https://blog.djangogirls.org/post/99309948348/your-django-story-meet-becky-smith](https://blog.djangogirls.org/post/99309948348/your-django-story-meet-becky-smith)

While Mark's name doesn't appear as often directly, I know for a fact that he's always actively involved in the background helping her run things. He's also known as a popular lightning talk moderator and giver of terrible (in a good way) talks.

#### Bill Deegan 

I, Phebe Polk, am writing to nominate Bill Deegan for PSF Fellow. He has demonstrated excellence in leadership of the Python community in code, community, and service.

Bill has been a lead maintainer of the scons library. This library is a top downloaded library on pypi.

[https://github.com/bdbaddog](https://github.com/bdbaddog) [https://pypistats.org/packages/scons](https://pypistats.org/packages/scons) [https://github.com/SCons/scons/commits?author=bdbaddog](https://github.com/SCons/scons/commits?author=bdbaddog)

Bill has also been an organizer of BayPIGgies and helps maintain baypiggies.net making posts for the website advertising BayPIGgies events for 10 years. Here is his first BayPIGgies website commits in August 2016. He has been a mentor to new leaders in the python community including his mentorship of Karen Dalton.

[https://github.com/BayPiggies/pelican_website/commits/master/?since=2016-08-01&until=2016-08-31](https://github.com/BayPiggies/pelican_website/commits/master/?since=2016-08-01&until=2016-08-31)

He continues to help organize BayPIGgies and we are grateful for his contributions.

#### Chris Brousseau 

*Selected in Q4 of 2025*

I, Phebe Polk, am writing to nominate Chris Brousseau for PSF Fellow. He has demonstrated excellence in leadership of the Python Community.

[https://github.com/surfaceowl](https://github.com/surfaceowl)

He has been a prolific speaker at the meetups for years speaking at Pyninsula, BayPIGgies, SF Python and [PyBay](./PyBay.html). His talks have always been novel, useful and entertaining contributions to the python ecosystem. He has also mentored speakers coming into the python speakers community including myself, Semona Igama and Darlene Wong. He is patient and kind, professional and principled.

Chris has served the community as the [PyBay](./PyBay.html) Committee Chair in 2024 and 2025. Chris has been an organizer of BayPIGgies since 2023 and helped lead the transition from online events to in person events. Chris has been elected to the Bay Area Python Association board in 2025 and we look forward to him serving through 2027.

#### James Abel 

*Selected in Q4 of 2025*

I, Phebe Polk, am writing to nominate James Abel for the role of PSF Fellow. He has demonstrated excellence and leadership in the Python Community in code, community and service.

His code contributions include capturing a bug in core python\'s windows distribution, along with several open source python packages available on pypi. His most notable projects include osnap, pyship, awsimple, and balsa.

[https://bugs.python.org/issue38344](https://bugs.python.org/issue38344)

[https://www.abel.co/](https://www.abel.co/)

[https://github.com/jamesabel](https://github.com/jamesabel)

His community contributions include being the senior organizer of SF Python from 2020 until today. This was a time of enormous turbulence at SF Python and he has been essential in providing a stable and respected presence for the python community. He took on the challenge of joining the newly formed Bay Area Python Association board, and was elected as the Director of the Board ( [https://www.bapya.org/about](https://www.bapya.org/about) ). Since then he has led the board to put on three successful [PyBay](./PyBay.html) conferences - the annual regional conference, and helped restore the integrity and credibility of the organization at large.

Finally he has mentored several people\'s journeys into joining the python community and becoming leaders within the regional organization including myself, Tiela Black-Law, Viorica Ciobanu, and so many others. He has been a selfless advocate devoting his time and energy to answering questions, reassuring nervous newcomers, and humoring innovative experiments.

I worry this is not specific enough advocacy, so I will end with a story about James.

In 2017 I was a Sr Data Analyst at [YouGov](./YouGov.html) programming in R for my day job, and writing fun python programs in my off time. The bus / train service had a 411 api and I wanted to know if I could make the bus when I left work at 5 pm or if I needed to wait in the comfortable office for another half hour so I wrote a command line tool in python. SF Python had a project night, and I went to project night to learn more about python. James had just retired from 40 years of working at Intel and instead of vacationing in Florida or Europe, he was presenting an open source project at project night. I met him there, and he became more interested in my project than his own project. He gave me fantastic advice on how to improve the project, fantastic advice on my next career moves and overall believed in me at a time when I wasn\'t sure of myself. That is why I am proud to nominate him for PSF Fellowship.

#### Kalyan Prasad 

I, Cheuk Ting Ho, PSF director and fellow would like to express my support for fellow application of Kalyan Prasad. Kalyan has been an active contributor in the India community for years and has been actively organising local conferences. Besides conference organisation, he has also been pushing for diversity and inclusion in his community. He has mentored other speakers and has been involved in CoC responses for conferences and [NumFocus](./NumFocus.html). His contributions are not limited locally, he has been helping other conferences such as [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) JP and [PyData](./PyData.html) Global. I think he would be a great addition to the PSF fellows and the PSF can benefit from his community contributions.

#### Karen Dalton 

*Selected in Q4 of 2025*

I, Phebe Polk, am writing to nominate Karen Dalton for the role of PSF Fellow. She has demonstrated excellence in leadership of the Python Community.

[https://github.com/kilodalton](https://github.com/kilodalton) [https://gecko.stanford.edu/people](https://gecko.stanford.edu/people) [https://www.bapya.org/about](https://www.bapya.org/about)

Karen Dalton has led the BayPIGgies python community meetup since 2020 and been a member since 2016. She has pioneered BayPIGgies transition through the pandemic and held community events every other month. She led the organization through the turbulent time of the pandemic with calm and poise. Firstly, she transitioned BayPIGgies to online events after BayPIGgies lost its location at [LinkedIn](./LinkedIn.html) headquarters. At this difficult time, she endured online harassment and organizer turnover while maintaining an unshakeable belief in the openness, importance and goodness of the python community. She has since led the transition back to in person events helping to land BayPIGgies a new home at SAP labs. She has mentored countless python newcomers including myself and Darlene Wong and so many others. She was so respected that she was invited to join the inaugural Bay Area Python Association Board. She did such an excellent job, she was resoundingly re-elected in 2023. Her current term runs through 2025 and she is still working tirelessly on behalf of the python community supporting [PyBay](./PyBay.html) and mentoring volunteers. She has led volunteer training and onboarding for [PyBay](./PyBay.html) in 2023, and 2024 when we had the largest cohort of over 50 volunteers.

Karen is community first. She has led with kindness and empathy for years and years. We are so lucky to have her.

#### Laís Carvalho 

*Selected in Q2 of 2025*

I, Sebastiaan Zeeff, propose that Laís Carvalho be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Laís has made significant contributions to the Python community as an organizer, diversity activist, speaker, and open-source advocate. The contributions she made to the Python community are too many to list, but include:

- Former committee/board member of Python Ireland

  Long-term organizing volunteer and emeritus board member of the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) Society Co-organizer of the Pyjamas Conferences Co-organizer of the first edition of [FlaskCon](./FlaskCon.html) Frequent organizer and community leader of [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) Dublin Organizer of Django Girls workshops Mentoring a lot of beginning Python developers at Humble Data workshops

In addition, I\'ve seen firsthand how Laís stepped up for the European Python community when it was dearly needed. When the board struggled, Laís went beyond what you may expect of a volunteer board member. Without her tremendous efforts and personal sacrifices, I do not think [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) 2024 would have been the success it was or would even have gone forward at all.

Laís brings people and communities together, including in her activities for [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html), black Python devs, and other underrepresented groups. In 2024, Laís was awarded the Q2 2024 PSF Community Service Award, but I feel she also deserves recognition as a Python Software Foundation Fellow.

I am not the only one who feels that Laís deserves this recognition, and I've included statements from people who support this nomination below.

\--

Lais has been committing herself in [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython), the Python and Pyladies community in Ireland, and Humble Data around the world. She brings joy everywhere she goes and has always outdone herself everytime a volunteer task is given to her. I would love to have her as a Python Software Foundation fellow for her contribution to the community.

Cheuk Ting Ho

\--

Artur Czepiel

\--

Lais works to be a fantastic advocate for the Python community. She has helped so many people from multiple cultures feel welcome and safe many miles from home. I've talked to countless people who are leaders in their community across several continents and it always seems that they have been inspired, encouraged, trained, or influenced by Lais and her work in some way. I definitely have as well.

Jay Miller

\--

It has been a privilege to know my friend Laís through the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) community for a number of years. In that time I have seen her determination and hard work bring important contributions and change to the European Python community: [PyBurger](./PyBurger.html)(!), her running of Humble Data, her significant voluntary contributions to the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) conference and her infectious enthusiasm and warmth all spring to mind. I can\'t think of a more deserving person to be nominated for PSF fellowship.

Nicholas H.Tollervey

\--

The Python Community is a richer and warmer place because of Laís. She has welcomed more than 10 ladies into tech not just python developers but also program managers into the tech scene. She is also consistently involved with [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) Dublin and is a force to reckon with in the community.

Velda Kiara

\--

Mariatta Wijaya

\--

Laís has dedicated years to running Python podcasts, building communities and events, speaking at Python conferences, and mentoring women in tech. She\'s a role model, a creator and a constant source of inspiration, and deserves recognition for her excellent contributions to the Python ecosystem.

Leon Sandøy & Ege Akman

\--

I, Naomi Ceder, would support the nomination of Lais Carvalho as a Fellow of the PSF.

I have known Lais for a number of years in connection with her work on [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) and Humble Data, and she has always been a leader by example, doing immense amounts of work to help events succeed. Beyond that, she has always put in extra effort to make sure that everyone feels included and welcome.

I can\'t express strongly enough that Lais embodies what we look for in a fellow - dedication to the community, willingness to work to ensure the success of community events and of others, and a willingness to teach and share her knowledge to bring in new members of the community.

She has my strongest support.

#### Lucie Anglade 

I, Arthur Vuillard, would like to nominate Lucie Anglade as a PSF Fellow.

Lucie has been active in the french Python community by organizing local meetups in Lyon (FR), by organizing multiple pycon.fr, and by being the chairwoman of the Association Francophone Python (AFPy - French speaking Python Association).

Lucie also works professionnaly with Python, by teaching it in multiple engineering school, and by developing Weasyprint, a tool/library that turns HTML/CSS to PDF.

#### Miguel Grinberg 

*Selected in Q3 of 2025*

I, Tomislav Kucar, propose that Miguel Grinberg be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as a speaker and as prolific author of both (open and free) books and countless articles, as well as open source code contributions. I personally taught dozens of friends and students not only web app dev using python but python itself using his great tutorials. For the past 10 years I have been using his \"The Flask Mega-Tutorial\" to provide my students both the end goal, and framework for learning the language - from first prints in REPL to complex rest-api\'s tested with pytest.

#### Simon Charette 

I, Ryan Siemens, would like to nominate Simon Charette for consideration as a Python Software Foundation Fellow.

Simon has made significant contributions to the Python community, primarily through his work with the Django project. Over the last decade he has made significant contributions to the Django ORM as well as the community at large. Simon currently serves on the Django security team as well as the triage and review team. He\'s been a Django Software Foundation member since 2014. Simon maintains a number of open source packages, he\'s been a keynote speaker at conferences, and can often be found in a github issue with a helpful reproduction or patch.

#### Sudharshan Tumkunta 

I, Sudharshan Tumkunta, am self-nominating for recognition as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to my significant contributions to the Python community through leading [PyTorch](./PyTorch.html) ([https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)) architectural improvements, educating and mentoring individuals in Python, publishing company articles on machine learning, mentoring Python users worldwide, speaking at international conferences, and being a long-term contributor to Microsoft and Meta\'s Python communities.

Details: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMo6q_O1WUM7MtWtvQeP0ty6078ee0dv/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=102372450291517545310&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMo6q_O1WUM7MtWtvQeP0ty6078ee0dv/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=102372450291517545310&rtpof=true&sd=true)

#### Will McGugan 

*Selected in Q2 of 2025*

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Will [McGugan](./McGugan.html) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Will is the creator of Rich and Textual.

These two open source projects are the main and now canonical way to display information on the terminal from Python applications. Before Rich, building CLIs in Python to display information was not as attractive and feasible. Now it\'s possible to build very polished-looking Python CLI programs, mainly thanks to these tools.

This has been a key factor in uncovering a big area where Python can be the main programming language, CLIs. This can greatly help the adoption of Python as a language and make it easier for developers to build great tools with it, expanding the number of use cases and developers that Python can help in general.

### 2025 Q1 Nominations 

#### Abigail Afi Gbadago 

I, Velda Kiara, strongly recommend Abigail Afi Gbadago for recognition as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation based on her contributions to the Python community and open-source ecosystem.

#### Ali Tavallaie 

I, Naghmeh Sharifi Zand, want to nominate Ali Tavallaie for PSF Fellow Membership because he has truly changed my life and the lives of so many others here.

Ali has been volunteering his time and energy for years to help people like me learn Python and build careers. He's been a managing member of the Iran Python community and Tehpug for over five years, organizing regular events, special gatherings, and even extra online sessions just to make sure everyone can join in and learn. And it's all volunteer work---he doesn't ask for anything in return. Why Ali Deserves This:

Support and Mentorship: Ali makes time for everyone. He's held workshops and even casual meetups, online or in person, where he answers our questions and guides us through Python. He's helped me learn how to use Python to earn money, something I never thought I'd be able to do.

Technical Contributions: He's worked on Python projects like PGMQ, CPython, and more libraries that I don't fully understand but know are important to developers all over the world.

Making Python Accessible: Ten years ago, he translated \"Think Python\" into Persian so more people could learn programming in their own language. He's also written blog posts full of useful tips and lessons, and he explains things in a way that anyone can understand.

Community Building: He's been giving talks about Python, AI, and programming tools for years, encouraging everyone---especially young people and women---to join the tech world.

Ali doesn't just teach Python; he builds confidence in people like me. Thanks to him, I've found opportunities I didn't think were possible. His gatherings feel like a family, where everyone is welcome, and no question is too small.

I really hope you'll consider him for the PSF Fellow Membership. Ali is one of those rare people who makes the world better, one Python session at a time.

#### Baptiste Mispelon

#### Ziyodkhan Atakhozhaev 

I, Guido van Rossum, nominate Ziyodkhan from Kyrgyzstan as a PSF Fellow.

His full name is Зиедхон Атахожаев (Google Translate gives \" Ziedkhon Atakhozhaev\"). He teaches informatics in Kyrgyzstan and had been elected teacher of the year before I heard from him.

I\'ve been communicating with Ziyod\[khan\] since 2018, when he sought my help to spread the word about Python in his country. I gave him encouragement and soon enough he had visited the Ministry of Education and organized a local [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon). He even sent me an official PyConKG T-shirt.

A few years later he organized a \"Summer Camp 21\".

This year he has already organized a Hackathon (using Python, Scratch and \"Hour of Code\"). See [https://www.facebook.com/kyrgyzinformatics/](https://www.facebook.com/kyrgyzinformatics/) for more about that.

I believe Ziyod has single-handedly kickstarted the use of Python in education in his country.

It would be a great honor for him to be elected Python Fellow. I definitely believe he fits in this category (from the Fellow Criteria):

- Nominated Person has served the Python community through extraordinary efforts in organizing Python events, publicly promoting Python, and teaching and coordinating others. Nominated Person\'s efforts have shown leadership and resulted in long-lasting and substantial gains in the number and quality of Python users, and have been widely recognized as being above and beyond normal volunteering.

I, Alyssa Coghlan, propose that Elena Williams be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as:

\* Canberra PUG founder (in 2012) and continuing organiser

\* PyLadiesAU co-founder 2011

\* Additional involvement in Perth PUG organisation (2013)

\* Organised second ever [DjangoGirls](./DjangoGirls.html) event (first without the DG founders)

- DG Brisbane (at PyConAU)

- DG Perth (+ 1st ever [RailsGirls](./RailsGirls.html) combined event)

- first DG Sydney

- first DG North America

- first DG Canberra

- DG Adelaide (at PyConAU)

\* DG work has sprouted off at least 2 substantial diversity in tech orgs in Australia. Most notably, the national and award winning \"[SheCodes](./SheCodes.html)\" (now 10 years old) was a direct product of the Perth DG event.

\* Sydney [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) co-founder 2014

\* Ongoing work, teaching, supporting and mentoring lots in Python related communities, particularly for Django (eg currently serving moderator Django Discord, Django CoC committee)

\* regular speaker at multiple Python Conferences

\* PyConAU core organiser (with an addition history of involvement in DjangoConAU and DjangoConUS

#### Charlie Marsh 

*Selected in Q1 of 2025*

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Charlie Marsh be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation.

Charlie is the creator of Ruff, uv, and founder of Astral.

With his open source work, he has been greatly improving the tooling for the Python ecosystem, increasing development speed/performance and joy for Python developers, making it much simpler to work with Python and to learn how to manage Python projects.

Work on tooling is very important for the adoption of the language, as that drives the ergonomics of using it. But it\'s very hard to make working on tooling sustainable, aligning the right incentives to make it happen.

Through his company, Astral, he\'s been able to direct funding to some of the long-time pains of Python, like packaging.

He is also hiring several of the developers tackling low-level complex problems and tools that enable all this work, like the Python-Rust integrations.

I think he, through his company (even if in the end it will have some type of commercial intention), is bringing a lot of improvements to Python ecosystem, and we are all, as a community, benefiting from it.

With his open source tools, he\'s tackling some of the most important and frequent \"complaints\" about the language and the ecosystem (as is packaging). This way, he\'s making Python a much more appealing language for newcomers and a much more enjoyable one for old-timers.

#### David Vas 

I, Miguel Magalhaes, propose that David Vaz and myself be recognized as a Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to our significant contributions to the Python community.

[PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal David and I founded [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal in 2022 and we have been the lead organizers since (3 editions in a row). The conference has been growing both in terms of days and content but also participants with a new record each year.The event has been essential in creating a local Python sense of community in Portugal which did not exist at all in the past. It follows an itenerating model where it takes place in a different portuguese city every year, so far it took place in Porto, Coimbra, and Braga this year. All the talks are published for free online for broader visibility. Moreover, we also have a grants program in place which is supported by the PSF, [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) Society and the DSF. All editions follow a public code of conduct which has been essential to make everyone feel welcomed.

[DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) Europe On top of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal, we have also organized multiple editions of the european Django conference. We have organized 2 virtual editions in 2020 and 2021, and 2 hybrid editions in Porto (Portugal) in 2022 and Vigo (Spain) in 2024. Moreover, we will also be organizing the next edition of the conference in Dublin (Ireland) in 2025. This conference also counts with a grants program, public code of conduct, discounted student tickets, and all the talks are published freely only afterwards.

Based on the wide impact of these 7 conference editions that we have organized so far, and the upcoming 2 editions next year. I believe we have demonstrated a deep Python community involvement worthy of being named as fellows.

#### Dhanush Kandhan 

I, Dhanush Kandhan, hereby nominate myself for Fellow Membership in the Python Software Foundation (PSF) based on my sustained contributions to the Python ecosystem and community. I have made meaningful contributions to prominent open-source Python packages, including [TensorFlow](./TensorFlow.html), and have been actively involved in Python education and community building initiatives.

As an instructor and mentor, I have successfully trained over 1,000 college students in Python programming and its modern package ecosystem, working in collaboration with the Government of Tamil Nadu, India. This educational initiative has focused on practical applications and integration with contemporary Python packages.

I am an active community volunteer of [ChennaiPy](./ChennaiPy.html) (chennaipy.org), the Python community in Chennai, where I contribute to fostering local Python expertise and collaboration. This involvement has allowed me to support both beginners and experienced developers in their Python journey.

Being recognized as a PSF Fellow would further motivate me to expand my contributions to the Python ecosystem and community. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve the Python community in this enhanced capacity.

#### Felipe de Morais 

*Selected in Q1 of 2025*

I, Felipe de Morais, am reaching out to submit my application for consideration as a Python Fellow, as I believe my contributions to the Python community align with the fellowship criteria.

My focus has been on building inclusive spaces and promoting diversity within the Python community. In 2019, I received the PSF's Q2 Community Award (link here) for these efforts, and I had the chance to share my journey on [GitHub](./GitHub.html)'s ReadME Project (link here).

As the founder of Afropython, I've created a platform to empower developers of African descent with mentorship and resources. Afropython has inspired similar initiatives like Black Python Devs (link here), amplifying our community's reach.

In alignment with the fellowship's focus on conference organizing, I helped establish [AfroPython](./AfroPython.html) Conf, a conference for the Black community in Brazil. Our events began with an in-person conference in 2019, moved online in 2022 with 18 sessions (2022 Playlist), and returned in person in 2023 in Salvador, Bahia. I was also part of the organization of the first Python Sul conference in southern Brazil, supporting the community with this important regional gathering.

I am inspired by the possibility of furthering my contributions as a Python Fellow and appreciate your consideration of my nomination.

\--

I, Naomi Ceder, nominate Felipe de Morais (AKA [AfroPython](./AfroPython.html)) as a Fellow of the PSF. Felipe has been a tireless promoter of the global Python community, both in Brazil as founder of [AfroPython](./AfroPython.html) and organizer of various events, giving his time and resources above and beyond.

He has also worked on updating [PyPy](../../implementations/PyPy) towards newer CPython versions, improved Windows and Mac OS support, maintained buildbot infrastructure, and has done the work of single-handedly moving the project\'s repository to Github to open the project for wider community participation.

In summary, he has worked continuously on most central components of [PyPy](../../implementations/PyPy) for more than a decade and thus has been, and continues to be, a vital part of the project\'s continued success.

#### Miguel Magalhaes 

I, Miguel Magalhaes, propose that David Vaz and myself be recognized as a Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to our significant contributions to the Python community.

[PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal David and I founded [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal in 2022 and we have been the lead organizers since (3 editions in a row). The conference has been growing both in terms of days and content but also participants with a new record each year.The event has been essential in creating a local Python sense of community in Portugal which did not exist at all in the past. It follows an itenerating model where it takes place in a different portuguese city every year, so far it took place in Porto, Coimbra, and Braga this year. All the talks are published for free online for broader visibility. Moreover, we also have a grants program in place which is supported by the PSF, [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) Society and the DSF. All editions follow a public code of conduct which has been essential to make everyone feel welcomed.

[DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) Europe On top of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Portugal, we have also organized multiple editions of the european Django conference. We have organized 2 virtual editions in 2020 and 2021, and 2 hybrid editions in Porto (Portugal) in 2022 and Vigo (Spain) in 2024. Moreover, we will also be organizing the next edition of the conference in Dublin (Ireland) in 2025. This conference also counts with a grants program, public code of conduct, discounted student tickets, and all the talks are published freely only afterwards.

Based on the wide impact of these 7 conference editions that we have organized so far, and the upcoming 2 editions next year. I believe we have demonstrated a deep Python community involvement worthy of being named as fellows.

#### Sage Sharp 

*Selected in Q1 of 2025*

#### Artur Czepiel 

*Selected in Q3 of 2024*

I, Mia Bajić, would like to nominate Artur Czepiel for the PSF fellowship for his exceptional contributions to the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) Society. He has played a key role in organizing Python Pizza in the Czech Republic and [PyData](./PyData.html) and Pykonik meetups in Krakow.

Artur began contributing to the Python community in 2017 by rewriting the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) website. He joined the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) Society Board in 2018 and served on it in 2021 and 2022. During his tenure, he led significant initiatives, including a major infrastructure migration and played an important role in venue selection and conference budgeting for 2019, 2022, and 2023.

Remarkably, he took a sabbatical to dedicate himself fully to enhancing the Society.

Artur also organized remote Python Pizza in 2020 and successfully brought it to the Czech Republic, spreading the event to other cities. Additionally, he has organized [PyData](./PyData.html) and Pykonik events in Krakow since 2017.

He is a true ambassador of the Python community, demonstrating unmatched dedication. I sincerely hope you consider him for the award.

#### David Hewitt 

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that David Hewitt, Messense, and Konstin be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation.

They are the main maintainers of [PyO3](./PyO3.html) and Maturin, the components providing Rust bindings for Python.

These tools have allowed a wave of new high-performance tools in Python, powered by Rust underneath. This includes packages like Cryptography, Pydantic, Polars, UV, and many others.

One of the main things people doubt about using Python is its performance, and these tools are giving Python a huge boost in performance capacity through libraries using them. That enables Python to be used in many complex and performance-heavy use cases where the alternative would have been to use another language. This way Python can cover even more fields, reassuring its position as the best language to use for the majority of use cases.

#### Konstin 

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that David Hewitt, Messense, and Konstin be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation.

They are the main maintainers of [PyO3](./PyO3.html) and Maturin, the components providing Rust bindings for Python.

These tools have allowed a wave of new high-performance tools in Python, powered by Rust underneath. This includes packages like Cryptography, Pydantic, Polars, UV, and many others.

One of the main things people doubt about using Python is its performance, and these tools are giving Python a huge boost in performance capacity through libraries using them. That enables Python to be used in many complex and performance-heavy use cases where the alternative would have been to use another language. This way Python can cover even more fields, reassuring its position as the best language to use for the majority of use cases.

#### Marcelo Trylesinski 

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Marcelo Trylesinski be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Marcelo started helping with the FastAPI community a few years ago, he became the top official FastAPI Expert ([https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts-all-time](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts-all-time)) due to his contributions helping others with their questions. That is a difficult, long and continuous task, that in most cases is not very visible or highlighted but is one of the most important tasks to foster a community. Through that, he has helped foster the welcoming culture in the FastAPI community.

Now he is also the maintainer of Starlette and Uvicorn, which are the building blocks of FastAPI and other tools. He now works for Pydantic, where he contributes as well.

He has been for a long time now helping with open source and communities around Python while ensuring that the Python community is healthy and welcoming.

#### Messense 

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that David Hewitt, Messense, and Konstin be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation.

They are the main maintainers of [PyO3](./PyO3.html) and Maturin, the components providing Rust bindings for Python.

These tools have allowed a wave of new high-performance tools in Python, powered by Rust underneath. This includes packages like Cryptography, Pydantic, Polars, UV, and many others.

One of the main things people doubt about using Python is its performance, and these tools are giving Python a huge boost in performance capacity through libraries using them. That enables Python to be used in many complex and performance-heavy use cases where the alternative would have been to use another language. This way Python can cover even more fields, reassuring its position as the best language to use for the majority of use cases.

#### Ruth Temiloluwa Afape 

I, David Mertz, wish to nominate as a PSF Fellow Temi Afape, whom I had the enormous pleasure of meeting in her role as an organizer of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Nigeria 2024.

Ruth Temiloluwa Afape is a passionate tech leader and community builder. She envisions a future where everyone has the power to create positive change through technology. Driven by this vision, she has dedicated her career to training, mentoring, and building communities that equip children, women, and young adults with the digital skills they need to thrive.

Temiloluwa\'s journey began with a deep faith in technology\'s transformative potential. She has tirelessly organized events and trainings and volunteered in organizations like Google Developers Group, Women Techmakers, Django Girls, and Python Nigeria, sparking young Africans\' interest in coding and empowering girls to build websites.

Since 2016, she has been involved in community development and driving effective changes in the technology space, primarily as it affects women and children. Her first community engagement was co-organizing Django Girls in Lautech, Oyo State. After that, she organized another Django Girls event in Onitsha, Anambra State, Lagos State, and Ogbomoso, Oyo State. Temiloluwa\'s commitment to empowering women in tech is further demonstrated through her volunteer work at several Django Girls events. She shared her expertise and knowledge at these events, coaching and inspiring ladies to build their first website.

In March 2018, Temiloluwa started Women Techmakers Lautech, now known as Women Techmakers Ogbomoso. There, she hosted an event for women in the community to celebrate those in technology and inspire those who want to work in it. Later that year, she was nominated to lead the Google Developers Groups in Ogbomoso, where she served as the lead for five years before leaving the community in 2024. In 2019, she was voted in as the treasurer for the Python Nigeria community, where she served for a year. In 2023, she was invited to the Python Nigeria board again, where she currently serves as the project manager for the community.

Fueled by a desire to create a lasting impact, Temiloluwa founded Rubies Technologies. This social enterprise empowers Africans, especially kids and teenagers, with the skills to develop innovative ideas and build sustainable solutions. Rubies Technologies has impacted close to 4000 Africans within and outside Africa. She currently leads over 30 individuals as a team lead and community/project manager for Rubies Technologies and Rubies Tech Foundation, advocating for the UN\'s Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Temiloluwa\'s commitment to empowering others shines through her leadership and dedication to building a brighter future for all.

#### Yifei Wang 

*Selected in Q2 of 2023*

My name is Le Zheng. I have a PhD in electrical engineering and I am currently a principal electrical engineer at a biotechnology startup Detect Inc. It's my pleasure to nominate Yifei Wang as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I have known her for over 2 years through a local Python community. During this time, I have witnessed her exceptional leadership in her efforts to promote Python programming and has made significant contributions to the Python community as a devoted educator, particularly in helping minority groups.

Yifei\'s dedication to teaching Python has resulted in long-lasting and substantial gains in the number and quality of Python users. She has given multiple talks at local conferences and career sessions about the importance of Python, and has dedicated a significant amount of time teaching Python to homeless children at Children Welfare Home in Nepal - a least developed country. Under her guidance, the group of orphans quickly transformed from having no experience with programming to being able to write simple programs, solve problems, automate tasks, and build amazing things. Yifei\'s efforts have had a lasting impact on these children, who are no longer just trying to survive day-to-day, but now have a sense of purpose and a new set of skills to help them succeed in life. They even started teaching other children in the shelter how to code, a testament to the effectiveness of Yifei\'s leadership.

Furthermore, Yifei has been a highly sought-after Python teacher at the local community, [SavvyUni](./SavvyUni.html), since 2017. Over the years, thousands of students have benefited from her classes and become excellent Python programmers from having zero knowledge on the field. She has also started the Women Initiative two years ago, a community aimed at helping women learn Python programming, demonstrating her commitment to diversity and inclusivity in the Python community.

Yifei\'s contributions to the Python community have been widely recognized as being above and beyond normal volunteering. Her efforts serve as a shining example of the power of programming to transform lives and make a positive impact on the world. For the orphans, local communities, and female communities, Yifei\'s teachings have opened up a whole new world of possibilities and opportunities that they never thought possible. As such, Yifei Wang is highly deserving of the recognition as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

In addition, Yifei has leveraged her bilingual expertise and technical skills to translate [NumPy](../../science/NumPy) documentation into Chinese to onboard more Chinese engineers. She is one of the top contributors since 2021. This helps to remove language barriers and makes the documentation more accessible to non-English speakers. This will lead to a more diverse and talented community of developers contributing to [NumPy](../../science/NumPy) and advancing the field of computer science as a whole.

### 2023 Q1 Nominations 

#### Barney Gale 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, David Lord (PSF Fellow 2020), propose that Barney Gale be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to improving Python\'s built-in pathlib library. Begining in February 2020, they have worked to gain support with core devs, created 70 PRs so far, and provided ongoing, detailed updates in the forum.

Here\'s an example of a post they make to keep the community updated on their work: [https://discuss.python.org/t/make-pathlib-extensible/3428/77](https://discuss.python.org/t/make-pathlib-extensible/3428/77)

Here\'s a list of pull requests they\'ve been working on in the cpython repository: [https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abarneygale+](https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abarneygale+)

#### Eric Traut 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Eric Traut be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to Python with [PyRight](./PyRight.html), the open source static analysis tool that powers VS Code\'s Python capabilities, and his contributions to improving how advanced libraries define data types with the new standard dataclass-transform.

[PyRight](./PyRight.html) is the tool that powers the Pylance extension, the official extension for VS Code to handle Python. It performs all the static analysis, which results in autocompletion and inline errors in the editor. It also has additional features.

He also contributed PEP 681 -- Data Class Transforms, originally as a draft in the [PyRight](./PyRight.html) repo. This enabled tools like Pydantic, Attrs, SQLModel, and others to declare that they exposed behaviors equivalent to dataclasses, and this way, allowed to get better support while working with these tools, including autocompletion and inline errors.

When he created the first draft of dataclass-transform, he added support for it in [PyRight](./PyRight.html), which enabled tools to take advantage of what was the new (future) standard even before it was official. This was adopted by Pydantic, Attrs, SQLModel, and others. And that way, the developer experience improved in VS Code (as it used [PyRight](./PyRight.html)) for those libraries. But all this work was done in a way that could be open and a standard (which it finally became), instead of as a closed extension tied exclusively to one vendor. I consider this work, the early adopters\' implementation, plus immediate adoption once it became a standard, and the effort to make all that work open and in a standard/official way highly commendable.

#### Gina Häußge 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, Miroslav Šedivý, a PSF Fellow, propose that Gina Häußge be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to her significant contributions to the Python community. In 2012, Gina \[1\] created a Python-driven software project [OctoPrint](./OctoPrint.html) \[2\], that became the standard in the open-source 3D printing community. Not only does she drive the development of this vibrant project, but she is also very actively participating in sprints and conferences and providing mentorship to other developers, both in person and as a frequent guest on various podcasts, sharing her knowledge and experiences with others and inspiring other developers to get involved in the open-source community.

\[1\] [https://foosel.net](https://foosel.net) \[2\] [https://octoprint.org/](https://octoprint.org/)

#### Grishma Jena 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, Upkar Lidder, propose that Grishma Jena be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to her significant contributions to the Python community. In 2016, Grishma taught Python to students from middle and high school as part of Program Your Future at UC Berkeley. She regularly taught Python and gave talks on Data Science at the San Francisco Public Library from 2017-18. She was also a mentor to high-school students as part of the non-profit AI4ALL's program and guided them in using Python to create an app that helps triage 911 calls.

From 2018, Grishma has delivered talks and workshops teaching Python, along with its applications for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. These have been for people across the globe including at [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) US, [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) (global), [PyConf](./PyConf.html) Hyderabad, [PyTennessee](./PyTennessee.html), [PyCaribbean](./PyCaribbean.html), Mini [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) (San Francisco), IBM (internal), IBM Developer and IBM Call for Code (global), [KeepCoding](./KeepCoding.html) (Madrid), and multiple other conferences across USA, Canada, India, and virtually. She frequently holds Python workshops for high school and university students. Grishma also helped create 2 external IBM professional certification exams (Data Science Professional and Certified Data Scientist - Watson Specialist) that help people prove their knowledge of Python and Python's Data Science tools and packages. Through her efforts, she has encouraged more than 1600 people to discover the magic of Python and to continue exploring it.

#### Martijn Pieters 

*Selected in Q2 of 2023*

I, Andrey Semakin, propose that Martijn Pieters be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contribution to the Python [StackOverflow](./StackOverflow.html) forum.

Martijn\'s homepage: [https://www.zopatista.com/](https://www.zopatista.com/) (all other contacts like Twitter can be found here). Just take a look at his SO page: [https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters](https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters) (over 1 million points of reputation!)

#### Samuel Colvin 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Samuel Colvin be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to Python with Pydantic.

Pydantic is an open source tool to perform data validation, serialization, parsing, and documentation. It powers FastAPI and many other libraries. It uses standard type annotations with standard types, which has also helped increase the adoption of type annotations in Python codebases, improving their type safety.

Recently he\'s been rewriting the internals of Pydantic in Rust, to improve its performance and add several features, while reducing the environmental cost of those thousands of codebases that use it.

#### Soon Seng Goh 

*Selected in Q1 of 2023*

I, Soong Chee Gi, propose that Mr Soon Seng Goh be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Mr Goh is a retired software developer who is passionate about imparting his knowledge to youths and adults. Driven by the observation of the shortage and lack of maker and tinkering coding education in mainstream schools (the percentage of K-12 students who reads a structured course of study in computer science and programming is typically about or less than 5%, or non-existent in most schools in Singapore) and the general population, he reached out to Singapore\'s National Library Board (NLB) to initiate an outreach program in NLB\'s [MakeIt](./MakeIt.html) makerspace facilities to the public library users. The program is a free five-week \[introductory Python programming with Raspberry Pi course\]([https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/communities/join/digital-communities](https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/communities/join/digital-communities)), with ad-hoc sessions held afterwards, targeting children as young as 9 years old and retirees as senior as 70+ aged, conducted weekly in English at MakeIT @ Tampines Regional Library. With the assistance of 3 regular volunteers, and sometimes her daughter supporting some sessions, he has successfully conducted 7 runs of the program to date (as at Feb 2023) since Sep 2021. He also adapted the course to a group of high school teachers to share how physical computing activities can be infused into their school enrichment programs, so that beginning programming learners can be meaningfully engaged with authentic tasks integrating both hardware and software.

Besides initiating the Pi with Python introductory course, Mr Goh also started a \[Pi Makers Club\]([https://github.com/ssgoh/The-Pi-Club](https://github.com/ssgoh/The-Pi-Club)) with NLB that meets on the first Sunday of each month in 2022, where members undertake more advanced projects using the Raspberry Pi. Starting 2023 the club has been exploring using the Raspberry Pi Pico, a microcontroller that runs [MicroPython](./MicroPython.html). He continuously seeks to not only initiate programs that welcome newcomers, but also thinks about longer term developmental plans to retain and sustain members\' interest.

All programme information and learning resources are \[shared with the community and open sourced\]([https://github.com/ssgoh](https://github.com/ssgoh)).

Mr Goh has also shared about his motivation and experience at \[[PyCon](PyCon) SG 2019 education summit\]([https://pycon.sg/edu-summit](https://pycon.sg/edu-summit)) (lightning talk: Making Python our Digital Mother Tongue) and \[[PyCon](PyCon) SG 2022 education summit\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkvsHHpfFIc&t=9508s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkvsHHpfFIc&t=9508s)) (talk: Pi and Python). His engagement talks have further inspired other educators to initiate similar ventures with the community libraries near their schools.

As a community which values diversity and inclusivity, the Python ecosystem is enriched with selfless contributors like Mr Goh who continues to care about and proactively reaches out to the more vulnerable segments of the society, even in his golden years.

I thus propose that Mr Soon Seng Goh be recognized as a PSF Fellow as he is deservingly a role model in his generation and beyond to inspire and encourage more Pythonistas from underrepresented groups, especially seniors who can still continue to lead purposeful lives by rediscovering the joy of learning and digital making with Python programming, an increasingly important core digital literacy life skill in today\'s technology permeated world, so that they are still meaningfully connected to society.

### 2022 Q4 Nominations 

#### Danny Adair 

*Selected in Q4 of 2022*

We write to you as past & present committee members of the New Zealand Python User Group - Ben Bradshaw (new Vice President), Tom Clark (President 2018-2022; sitting committee member), Carlos Cordero (Treasurer since 2018), and myself (exiting Vice President, newly retired).

We would like to jointly nominate Danny Adair to be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Danny founded the NZPUG ([https://python.nz/](https://python.nz/)) in 2009, and sat as President until stepping down to Committee member in 2018; his unbroken tenure continues still, as he was re-elected by our membership this week during our AGM. He was also the guiding force that led NZPUG to become a Registered Charity in early 2016 - not an easy feat in the face of Charities legislation.

During his time as founder and President, Danny has also been organiser for a number of our annual Kiwi [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) conferences in the Far North, Auckland, and Wellington - and has been Sponsorship Coordinator for all 11 Kiwi [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon)\'s held during the existence of NZPUG. During all this, Danny has been the organiser of the monthly Wellington NZPUG meetups for many years, and provides ongoing support for our five meetup groups across the country.

Danny himself has been a steadfast promoter of Python in New Zealand for decades now, and his name is deeply connected with an unswerving commitment to community - and unity - in our shared appreciation of Python. It is difficult to think of any other person who has single-handedly had such a strong and enduring influence on the Python community within New Zealand. NZPUG - quite literally - would not exist without him.

We passionately advocate for his formal recognition as a Fellow of the PSF.

#### Yung-Yu Chen 

*Selected in Q4 of 2022*

I, Iqbal Abdullah, a PSF Fellow, would like to nominate Yung-Yu Chen (or widely known as YYC) as a PSF Fellow to acknowledge his efforts in building a base for the Python community in Taiwan and the East Asian region.

YYC started the first [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) TW in 2012 ([https://tw.pycon.org/2022/en-us/about/history](https://tw.pycon.org/2022/en-us/about/history)) as the first chair and continued to lead the organizing team up until [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) APAC 2015.

YYC now doesn\'t participate actively in the organizing of conferences and community events, but this is where his leadership and his contribution to our community shines: His vision has enabled the [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) TW community to have a strong succession plan. [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) TW continues to show robustness in promoting Python within its community, and even when other communities were unable to stand up to organize a regional conference for 2022, [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) TW took up the task with their batch of young leaders. As Naomi Ceder put it: \"There is no leadership when you don\'t have a succession plan\" (or something to that effect).

YYC continues to participate in regional discussions and is active in recruiting young people from his community to get involved in other regional conferences to increase partnership within the region. In his professional life, he is also active in promoting diversity (i.e gender diversity by encouraging and training young female engineers to speak at conferences and opportunities to gain skills). He is still actively contributing his time, experience and knowledge giving ideas and helping improve partnerships between the different communities in East/South East Asia.

I have also personally realized how easy it is for us to miss this type of community work: We tend to focus on the right here and right now, but we tend to miss the ones that only show their results 5 or 10 years down the line. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge my compatriot YYC with this nomination.

#### Soong Chee Gi 

*Selected in Q4 of 2022*

I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Soong Chee Gi be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Soong Chee\'s contribution to the Python community in APAC generally and to the youths of Singapore cannot be understated and should be recognized.

Soong Chee\'s have been teaching Python for high school children in Singapore and have taken initiatives to bring them to [PyCons](./PyCons.html) within this region, exposing them to the larger community, while giving them opportunities to give talks on their own experiences using and developing with Python.

He also organizes Education Summit alongside [PyCons](./PyCons.html) to initiate dialogue, increase awareness of the importance of programming within the syllabus and also as a support group for educators in the field within this region.

Soong Chee might not be as prolific as other members and organizers of our community, due to his humble personality and so it is more important that we highlight the work that people like him have done. Soong Chee is not only a mere organizer: In all my years working with the community in this region, he is perhaps the only organizer working to create a better future for the community and the language: By working directly with our future, the school children.

We need to recognize more selfless individuals like Soong Chee within the APAC region, who needs to be shown as role-models to further motivate our communities within this region

You can find more about Soong Chee here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFWqbbysE4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFWqbbysE4s) [https://nie.edu.sg/profile/gi-soong-chee](https://nie.edu.sg/profile/gi-soong-chee)

#### Josef Heinen 

*Selected in Q4 of 2022*

I, Reimar Bauer, propose that Josef Heinen be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to his significant contributions to the Python community as maintainer and lead developer of the GR framework for cross-platform visualization applications. The framework can be used as a backend for Matplotlib and can significantly improve the performance of existing Matplotlib or [PyPlot](./PyPlot.html) applications. Unlike Matplotlib, GR can also be used in traditional (C, C++) and other REPL languages (Julia, Ruby) with various toolkits (e.g. Qt) or in web-based applications. Josef Heinen spoke on the [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython), [SciPy](SciPy), PyConUS, PyConDE conference series.

I, Georg Brandl, support the nomination.

#### Dr. Philip Jones 

*Selected in Q2 of 2023*

I, Yeray Díaz, would like to propose that Dr. Philip Jones be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Dr. Jones [https://pgjones.dev/](https://pgjones.dev/) is the author of the Quart web framework [https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/), a fully async port of the extremely popular Flask web framework and author of many plugins for Quart, such as Quart-Auth [https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-auth/index.html](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-auth/index.html) and Quart-Schema [https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-schema/index.html](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-schema/index.html). He is also the author of Hypercorn [https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/), a highly performant ASGI web server. He recently joined the prominent Pallets [https://github.com/orgs/pallets/people](https://github.com/orgs/pallets/people) development group and has been collaborating on maintaining several of their project, including Flask, Jinja, and Werkzeug. He\'s also a member of the python-hyper [https://github.com/python-hyper](https://github.com/python-hyper) group where he maintains sans-io libraries such as h2 [https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2](https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2) and wsproto [https://github.com/python-hyper/wsproto](https://github.com/python-hyper/wsproto).

I believe his body of work and commitment to the language and Open Source are more than enough to warrant him this recognition.

#### Hugo van Kemenade 

*Selected in Q4 of 2022*

I, Mariatta Wijaya, propose that Hugo van Kemenade be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community.

Hugo is a maintainer of the pillow library ([https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)). He has been actively contributing to CPython in various areas: code, documentation, infrastructure, and tooling. Hugo has been an active member of the Python Triage team since January 2022. At the time of writing this, Hugo is being considered for Python core devs privileges.

### 2022 Q3 Nominations 

#### Iqbal Abdullah 

*Selected in Q3 of 2022*

I, Kwon-Han Bae, propose that Iqbal Abdullah be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I met him at [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) APAC 2013 ([https://apac-2013.pycon.jp/](https://apac-2013.pycon.jp/)). At that time, [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) APAC was just 3 countries ( SG, JP, TW ). With the support of people including Iqbal, I started [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) KR 2014 the next year.

Since then, Iqbal has attended [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) KR multiple times even though most of presence was made in Korean, which he doesn\'t understand. He gave some talks in English and supported [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) KR to hold [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) APAC 2016.

#### Kwon-Han Bae 

*Selected in Q3 of 2022*

I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Kwon-Han Bae be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Kwon-Han\'s contribution to the Python community in APAC generally and South Korea specifically cannot be understated and should be recognized. He was one of the founding members of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) KR, starting it from humble beginnings in 2014 and now hosts over 1800 Pythonistas yearly in the biggest conference venue in South Korea.

Kwon-Han was also a leading figure galvanizing support and volunteers to take part and host [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) APAC 2016 together with South Korea\'s East Asian neighbours Taiwan and Japan.

Currently, he does not actively participate in organizing the community as before. He has done a wonderful job of passing on the responsibilities to the next generation of organizers, which I believe is a key reason for the success of the Python community in South Korea. He now plays an important leading role in managing and getting the various communities in East and South East Asia to work together and maintain good relationships to further the values and promote Python through [PyCons](./PyCons.html) within the region, which goes far beyond \"just organizing events\".

We need to recognize more selfless individuals like Kwon-Han within the APAC region, who needs to be shown as role models to further motivate our communities within this region.

#### Archana Vaidheeswaran 

*Selected in Q2 of 2022*

I, Briana Augenreich, propose Archana Vaidheeswaranbe be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to her significant contributions to the Python community - which I truly hope are recognized and rewarded.

Archana has spent the last 1.5 years leading Women Who Code Python as a leadership fellow and now senior leadership fellow. During her time she has led a team of 50+ women and organized over 40+ events covering data science, database technology, intro to python, creating bots, and machine learning to name a few. Along with these events she was instrumental in building an active and engaged community of 2000+ members with initiatives like slack pythonic Thursdays, a mentoring program, and trivia Tuesdays on the Women Who Code social channels.

#### Denny Perez 

*Selected in Q1 of 2022*

I, Cristián Maureira-Fredes, would like to nominate Denny Perez to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to her significant contributions to the Python community, particularly for all her work empowering the Spanish speaking community in many countries.

Denny has been in touch with different groups and activities around Python and Open Source since 2019. She created a group called "Chicas en Programación Mtl" with a few Latin women in Montreal, where she organized many events in person, and helped as a mentor while teaching Python from scratch. When the pandemic worsened, the group was a bit stalled, but she started to look for other initiatives where she could help, joining as a coordinator in the Python en Español Discord Server \[1\] which is a community that aims to gather all the Spanish speaking Python community.

She has been volunteering in many Python conferences in any area that needed help, just to name a few:

#### Paul McGuire 

*Selected in Q2 of 2022*

I, Steve Holden (former chairman of the PSF and a director for 8 years), hereby propose that Paul [McGuire](./McGuire.html) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to his significant contributions as creator and long-term maintainer of the popular open source pyparsing package. I have personally observed his support of the Python community both in that work (where he has built and supported an extremely competent team to support the project) and in the [StackOverflow](./StackOverflow.html) Python chat room where he is a long-time active participant. His Stackoverflow page at [https://stackoverflow.com/users/165216/paulmcg](https://stackoverflow.com/users/165216/paulmcg), with its typically modest description, gives more background to support this nomination. As a result of his acknowledged expertise, Paul was invited to join the authors of the 4th edition Python in a Nutshell, which will be a better book for his participation due to his all-round Python knowledge in depth.

#### Priyanshu Agarwal 

I, Priyanshu Agarwal, propose myself to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to my significant contributions to the Python community.

I am an active contributor to various open source projects. I have made significant code contributions, along with extensive tests and documentation coverage, to the python package PyBaMM. It houses state-of-the-art automatic differentiation and numerical solvers that solve physics-based electrochemical DAE models. As part of my Google Summer of Code, I adapted PyBaMM's expression trees to render mathematical equations in latex using [SymPy](../../people/SymPy). I have taken full ownership of the project by not just working on the requirements that were laid out originally but also contributing my own ideas. Recently, I took the initiative to automate PyBaMM's release workflow on PyPI and am now the maintainer of this repository on conda-forge. I am also trying to build a community and attract additional contributors to the project by delivering a talk at the Faraday Institute, UK, and hosting AMA sessions. In addition, I recently signed on as a contributor to liionpack, a PyBaMM offshoot project, to kickstart its development. I am also a part of various communities like Google Developer Group Pune and [PythonPune](./PythonPune.html). I strongly believe in Python and hope to become a Python Software Foundation fellow member.

When working in academia, Sarah contributed to Python projects like [InstrumentKit](./InstrumentKit.html) that were critical in enabling reproducible research via instrument automation. She helped not only her lab, but many others all over the world migrate away from closed source and expensive commercial tools to Python and Jupyter notebook based workflows by giving workshops, talks and writing documentation.

She is currently an active developer on Mitiq \[5\], a Python compiler for error mitigation of quantum programs. This is a keystone tool that enables folks to use current and near-term quantum devices by reducing the errors in the results. This project has integrations with almost every major quantum computing provider and simulator and has been cited in several recent research papers. She helps run the weekly community calls for Mitiq, and helps troubleshoot and answer community questions on the project's Discord.

\[5\]: [https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

She also works with many Python maintainers on open source projects to help them develop best practices for their projects as well as hosts/produces interviews \[6\] on Twitch with maintainers on Python open source projects which helps feature and promote their projects as well as find great contributors. Whenever a new project is started, she always is ready to help get codes of conduct setup, as well as other tools and processes to help keep our spaces safe and welcoming to all.

\[6\]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxyqJDC4SUo&list=PL-VMs2BCTI_nnSQmBaccJ1CdQfw5cpHSp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxyqJDC4SUo&list=PL-VMs2BCTI_nnSQmBaccJ1CdQfw5cpHSp)

Python is critical to the success of quantum computing, from the research happening in the labs, to connecting with the broader community of users of the technology. Now, almost every major quantum project is written in, or interoperates with Python. Sarah's contributions have been critical in enabling the people, projects and communities that will continue to realize the potential of building quantum technology with Python.

#### John Hawley, Matthew Lagoe, James Lopeman

#### Ana Dulce 

*Selected in Q4 of 2021*

I, Marco Rougeth, propose that Ana Dulce be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Ana Dulce has been doing great work in the brazilian Python community for quite some time. More recently, she took the lead when nobody else wanted and organized Python Brasil conference in 2020 (first time online edition). She was also a key member of the organization team in the 2019 and 2021 editions of the conference.

Ana has been around since [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) Brasil was created in 2014 and she also has been an active member of the Sao Carlos\' [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) branch. Over the years, she organized several meetups and study groups, taught programming to young girls from elementary and hight schools, gave talks and tutorials, helped with social media. The list goes on and on.

She likes to says that she prefers the \"background\" type of work in the community, mostly likely why she hasn\'t been recognized as a PSF Fellow yet.

#### Aidis Stukas 

I, Harald Armin Massa, propose that Aidis Stukas be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I nominate him because of his significant contributions to the Python community. Aidis has been serving as the chair of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Lithuania ([PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) LT) since 2017. While serving as chair of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) LT, he grew the conference from \~80 participants to \~330 participants, from a single day event into a 2 day event in 2019, with 10+ foreign speakers, 4 tracks, a Django girls session. Even more significant, he travelled to [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython) (with the help of a PSF grant) to connect with international Pythonistas, to recruit them to come to Lithuania and speak at [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) LT. In my eyes, crossing the boarder and connecting one national Python community with the global Python world is a very important step. Beyond chairing the event, he also developed and engaged a team of Pythonistas to run the conference, motivated Mantas Zimnickas, Jurgis Pralgauskis, Laurynas Speičys, Inga Pliavgo, Dainora Bucyte and some others to work on the conference. In addition to [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) LT, Aidis organizes mutliple Python Meetups in Lithuania: [KaunasPy](./KaunasPy.html) (www.meetup.com/KaunasPy/). [PyData](./PyData.html) Kaunas (www.meetup.com/PyData-Kaunas/)

Also nominated by Mike Müller

#### Arnaud Legout 

I, Jean-Frédéric Gerbeau, propose that Arnaud Legout and Thierry Parmentelat be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as co-authors of the most popular MOOC on Python in the French speaking countries. This MOOC, first created in 2014, and largely updated with the latest Python progress, reached 110,000 students in 101 countries. It is the official resource for all French high schools and undergrad professors to learn Python. Therefore, this MOOC has structured the learning Python in France. The nominees have also made a significant contribution to the use of the Python notebook in educational resources by using it since 2014 in the first edition of their MOOC Python.

#### Thierry Parmentelat 

I, Jean-Frédéric Gerbeau, propose that Arnaud Legout and Thierry Parmentelat be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as co-authors of the most popular MOOC on Python in the French speaking countries. This MOOC, first created in 2014, and largely updated with the latest Python progress, reached 110,000 students in 101 countries. It is the official resource for all French high schools and undergrad professors to learn Python. Therefore, this MOOC has structured the learning Python in France. The nominees have also made a significant contribution to the use of the Python notebook in educational resources by using it since 2014 in the first edition of their MOOC Python.

#### Thomas Caswell 

*Selected in Q2 of 2022*

I, Madicken Munk, would like to nominate Thomas Caswell to be recognized as a fellow of the python software foundation. Thomas Caswell is the current project lead of Matplotlib, the most widely used plotting package in the scientific Python community and I can\'t recommend him enough for this honor. Tom is a thoughtful leader that thinks about the software he maintains and how it fits into the broader scientific Python ecosystem, and is an active participant and organizer of scientific Python events.

Tom is a strong leader guiding matplotlib into the future. He seeks out independent funding to ensure stability in matplotlib\'s development and maintenance, and is broadly welcoming and encouraging to all contributors to the project and to people joining the scientific Python community. Under Tom\'s leadership, a number of people have dedicated funding to develop and work on matplotlib, and matplotlib\'s community has grown as a result. Because matplotlib serves as a backend for many other scientific Python visualization packages like my own, their stability and maintenance benefits the development communities of many other packages.

For the past several years Tom has co-organized the tools plenary at [SciPy](SciPy), which involves reaching out to various maintainers of projects in the scientific python ecosystem. Tom is thoughtful about how these packages are chosen, and tries to balance well-known core projects with newer projects that need an introduction to the community. At [SciPy](SciPy), Tom sought out other visualization package leaders to come up with standards for interoperability between visualization packages, making working in the ecosystem easier for users. Tom is always present during the sprints after [SciPy](SciPy) concludes, and takes time to mentor potential contributors to matplotlib. Tom also was one of the individuals who spearheaded the effort for NEP 29, which set standards for when various Python versions would be supported and dropped in scientific python packages. This was a huge benefit to package maintainers like myself, and has been widely adopted by many core packages.

#### Reshama Shaikh 

*Selected in Q2 of 2022*

I (Gael Varoquaux) would like to nominate Reshama Shaikh as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I am interacting with Reshama via scikit-learn. In addition to her technical contributions, she does an amazing work on community and communication, organizing sprints, animating our social medias, and overall helping shaping the community by suggesting good people. She is hard at work on diversity and inclusion, with manners and messages so gentle that they make everybody happy. She has an incredibly good spirit and is really committed to building a better Python ecosystem. I know that she is active on other projects beyond scikit-learn.

#### Matteo Benci 

*Selected in Q2 of 2022*

I, Patrick Arminio, nominate Matteo Benci. He\'s currently the treasurer of Python Italia, which is already a very important role, but in addition to that he\'s helping a lot with the organization of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Italy and all the other events we try to do ([PyFest](./PyFest.html), Django Girls and so). He\'s probably the most active member in our community and I think his involvement should be rewarded 😊 I don\'t think we\'d be able to do all the amazing things we do without him. He was interviewed recently about his community involvement, unfortunately the interview is only in italian: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnFMaxZgsI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnFMaxZgsI)

### 2021 Q3 Nominations 

#### Anthony Sottile 

*Selected in Q3 of 2021*

I, Jürgen Gmach, propose that Anthony Sottile be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages: - pytest - flake8 - tox - pre-commit - all-repos - pyupgrade and many more.

He also maintains the deadsnake-ppa, which enables all Ubuntu users to install Python versions via a package manager which are not included by Ubuntu by default.

He shares his knowledge via [YouTube](./YouTube.html), via Twitch streams and also online at his discourse board.

He also fixes critical bugs in cpython or never hesitates to help other open source maintainers with extremely difficult problems.

The Python world would be very different without him.

#### Bernát Gábor 

*Selected in Q3 of 2021*

I, Jürgen Gmach, propose that Bernát Gábor be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages: - tox - virtualenv - build - pipx and many more.

He shares his knowledge on various discord channels.

One thing I admire most - he tries to empower new contributors, by supporting them to create Pull Requests, but also he tries to get new contributors into becoming future maintainers, and he spends a significant time preparing them for future tasks.

The Python world would be very different without him.

### 2021 Q2 Nominations 

#### João Bueno 

*Selected in Q2 of 2021*

I, Bruno Rocha, propose that João Bueno (a.k.a JS) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python and open-source software community.

He is one of the most active users of stack overflow answering all kinds of Python related questions both in English and Portuguese, the total number of answers he has selected there is awesome, too many newcomers and experienced developers have been helped by him.

He is one of the founding members of Python Brasil Association and Conference, co-founder of a hacker space and an excellent teacher and speaker on meetups and conferences.

JS is one of the smartest developers I know and he was a great source of inspiration when I started my career as a Python developer many years ago.

And most importantly, he is one of the core developers of GIMP (our lovely Linux Imaging Editing software)

#### Jakub Baláš 

*Selected in Q2 of 2021*

I, Tomas Pytel, propose that Jakub Baláš be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a co-organiser of the monthly python meetups called \"Brněnské Pyvo\" in Czech Republic. Also, he is always helpful when I talk with him about Slovak Meetups - Bratislava Python Meetup, where I am a co-organizer.

Jakub is also a regular speaker at PyConSK where I think he is a big popularizer of python in the space industry, and his talks have always filled the biggest halls of PyConSK. As much as possible during the conference, he actively communicated with the participants and IMHO it was really visible that he is fully dedicated to Python. I think he, as a PyConSK speaker, back then helped us in organizing PyConSK, so he was actively searching/looking for us speakers in Britain when he worked there. This helped us, for example, to get one or two more good speakers. Really, as I\'ve seen it later when meetups are dying for lack of interest, Jakub is really trying to make the Czech community around python really live and be really active, and I think he\'s doing very well.

#### Sony Valdez 

I, Sony Valdez, propose myself to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I have made significant contributions to the Python community as a co-founder of Python.PH in 2013, served as president from 2013 to 2016, currently serve as Board of Trustee in said organization as Director of Community Relations, chairman for [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Philippines 2014 and 2015, help organized [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Philippines from 2016 to 2019, pioneered teaching Python in education at our country back in 2011, and a long time contributor to the local Python community in the Philippines.

#### Jukka Lehtosalo, Ivan Levkivskyi, and Michael J. Sullivan 

*Selected in Q2 of 2021*

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Jukka Lehtosalo, Ivan Levkivskyi, and Michael J. Sullivan be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community with their work on mypy.

mypy lead to the development and integration of type annotations/type hints to the language itself.

And these type annotations have improved code safety in many code bases (using mypy), the developer experience with editors supporting these type annotations, and new tools like dataclasses in the standard library, and other tools from the community, like pydantic, FastAPI, Typer, and many others.

#### Miroslav Šedivý

#### Mikhail Kashkin 

My name is Mikhail Kashkin and I want to nominate myself as PSF Fellow Member. This is my story: In 2000, I\'ve started to work on my first paid office job. And my first project was on Perl. After year of development I found that I barely understand my own code and when I need to fix something I tend to rewrite code from scratch instead of changing it. Because Perl syntax was just unreadable. So, I decided to look into other programming languages and found Python --- clean and beautiful language. That becomes my love and main language for the next 20 years. When I started to learn python it was hard to find documentation in Russian language, my mother tongue. Lack of documentation and knowledge led me to mail lists. I started to teach myself Python by asking help from the community and feel that I need to pay back. That is how I become active community member and soon promoter of the Python. In few years I become the first member of the Plone Foundation from ex-USSR countries. My company Key Solutions was listed as solution provider and python developers company on many sites (it that times it was popular). Also, my employer and colleague Andrey Orlov was paid maintainer for Python builds in [AltLinux](./AltLinux.html) distribution ([http://sisyphus.ru/ru/srpm/Branch3/rpm-build-python/changelog](http://sisyphus.ru/ru/srpm/Branch3/rpm-build-python/changelog)). And author of the Python Policy for that distribution. I created the site Plone.org.ru to unite people who are interested in Plone, Zope and Python. Later I passed maintenance of the site to the community, but you can see that most news posts are from me here [https://plone.org.ru/newsitems/](https://plone.org.ru/newsitems/). My username on this site is `xen`{.backtick}. I\'ve coordinated translation to Russian of Plone book ([https://plone.org.ru/books/pb/ru/](https://plone.org.ru/books/pb/ru/)) and made proofreading and formatting of the content contributed by other people. BTW, I\'m not sure about rights to this book. We didn\'t sell it, so I hope it doesn\'t violate somebody\'s rights. During Key Solution times I\'ve created more than 100 sites using Python. Include some big names: Association CRM of Russia and CIS, Russia Sport Channel, and biggest real estate agency MIEL.ru. As active open source contributor I won award Open Source Contributor 3rd place by opennet.ru site [http://www.opennet.ru/konkurs/result-1.shtml](http://www.opennet.ru/konkurs/result-1.shtml) (in Russian). From 2008 year I moved to Ukraine and become one of co-organizer of the [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Ukraine conference as keynote speaker. Solo I organized events in Dnipro, Lviv, Odessa, Kharkhiv. But not only in Ukraine. During my business or holiday travels I\'ve become speaker in Thailand, Armenia, Russia. Some videos from events are available on my Youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0xkFZv2Df0&list=PLyUvGavKi98XnK4xwtsmwrtYdYoUnnxQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0xkFZv2Df0&list=PLyUvGavKi98XnK4xwtsmwrtYdYoUnnxQk). Two years ago (in 2018) I decided to start consulting and education projects. Soon one of my clients becomes Yandex and I created big part of Backend Developer course [https://praktikum.yandex.ru/backend-developer/](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/backend-developer/). In the first month after started courses team shared numbers I can\'t say exactly how many people become students and numbers was impressive. More important that I saw students code. It was very good. I\'m proud to be process that give these people the chance to become Python developers.

Now I run my own python education course on [https://Pylot.me](https://Pylot.me) and education platform [https://Okumy.com](https://Okumy.com).

To sum things up: - I have always worked closely with the community - As speaker participated in more than 100 events in last 20 years - Helped hundreds of people to start using Python - Worked with the biggest IT companies as python expert. Including: Google, Yandex, Mamba, etc - A lot of people associate my name to Python - Helped to translate or wrote a lot of articles about Python or how to become Python developer - Contributed to Plone (was Foundation Member), Zope, and other projects - Run python teams and promoted Python as basic technology in many startups I had envolved

My social links: - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkashkin/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkashkin/) - [https://github.com/xen](https://github.com/xen) - [https://www.pylot.me/](https://www.pylot.me/) - [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzClGkSdFfjursCUsp6T_bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzClGkSdFfjursCUsp6T_bQ)

I hope my contribution to the community will help to become Python Foundation fellow member.

### 2021 Q1 Nominations 

#### Joseph Banks, Leon Sandøy, and Sebastiaan Zeeff 

*Selected in Q1 of 2021*

The Python Discord staff proposes that Joseph Banks, Leon Sandøy, and Sebastiaan Zeeff be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the owners of Python Discord.

Python Discord is a community for Python learning and discussion that has been active since 2017, and in that time they have worked diligently to foster a culture of warmth and inclusivity for all individuals regardless of their background or level of Python knowledge, even as the number of members has climbed above 140,000. Each day, Python Discord facilitates hundreds of live help sessions and numerous discussions in which both novices and experts participate. In addition to creating a place where tens of thousands of people have learned about the Python ecosystem, they have maintained an active role by leading semi- annual code jam events ([https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/)) and creating the Sir Lancebot project ([https://github.com/python-discord/sir-](https://github.com/python-discord/sir-) lancebot), which introduces beginners to open-source Python development. In their work with other parts of the Python ecosystem, they have given the organisers of [PyWeek](../../people/PyWeek) a space in the community last year in order to increase the visibility of that long-standing event. They have also supported the PSF by hosting the most recent core developer sprint and the subsequent live Q&A stream.

For these reasons we believe that these three have done a great service to the Python language and ecosystem at large, and we hope that the committee will accept them as fellows.

#### Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich 

*Briana Augenreich selected in Q1 of 2021*

I, Shanna Gregory, propose that Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the Leadership Fellows for the Women Who Code Python track community.

Bri and Archana have coordinated dozens of Python events for an international community and lead a team of dedicated volunteers who support Python study groups and speaker series. They have grown the WWCode Python community to over 2k active members. Both serve on the CFP Committee for Women Who Code CONNECT, a global developer conference series, and ensure quality Python presentations at each conference.

#### Michael Iyanda 

*Selected in Q3 of 2021*

I, Chukwudi Nwachukwu, propose that Michael Iyanda be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Michael is a proactive, and progressive member of the Python Community in Nigeria and he has dared go to where others couldn\'t go.

Michael lives in Bauchi State (Northern Nigeria) and he has been helping to push the Python Community in that domain for years, since I have known him. He did these by coaching, in the past, in many Django based events and even, at a time, acting as Python Nigeria\'s IT Director.

He exudes confidence in his tasks as he goes about doing his best to see such through. Plus, he is generous too. By being a Fellow of PSF and championing the Python cause where he resides and beyond, he will be able to create more awareness of the community. In my interactions with him, I do find him fit for the tasks ahead.

#### Zac Dodds 

*Selected in Q1 of 2021*

I, Ryan Soklaski, propose that Zac Dodds be recognized as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Zac is a generous, proactive, and progressive member of the Python community and is a prolific contributor to Python's ecosystem.

He is a developer for the Hypothesis testing project, and is, by far, its most active maintainer. This is a cutting-edge library that puts Python at the forefront of languages with advanced (but accessible) methods/tooling for writing automated tests for software. That he maintains a library of this caliber and importance in his free time is impressive indeed.

Zac is an active contributor to the various Python conferences; he has delivered talks, tutorials, and posters at [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon), [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Australia, [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) India, [EuroSciPy](./EuroSciPy.html), and others. In addition to delivering talks and tutorials, he also served as a mentor for [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon)'s mentored sprints for diverse beginners, and he often organizes a week-long sprint for people interested in Hypothesis.

In terms of the support that Zac provides to the Python ecosystem... it is downright herculean. He developed hypothesmith, which is a library that can generate valid Python programs to be tested. This is used to fuzz Instagram's LibCST program, Black (the auto-formatter), and CPython itself. Zac has also contributed powerful property-based tests to pydantic, isort, caught bugs looming in Python 3.10, and much much more. His contributions go far beyond what I listed here.

The reason why I know Zac is that I posted an issue on Hypothesis, a couple of years ago, when I was trying to learn how to write tests for an educational tool that I was creating. This was one of my first experiences in the world of open-source software ever; I was nervous and a bad experience would have sent me packing. Zac was so kind, encouraging, and generous with the help he provided me that I felt motivated to become more active in the Python community -- my life has changed because of this. No matter who he is interacting with, Zac is kind, inclusive, humble, and supportive. I model myself after him when I interact with people on [GitHub](./GitHub.html) and other platforms, and it makes me a better member of this community.

I could go on and on, but I hope that I have made a convincing case that Zac is an outstanding and admirable individual who makes the world of Python better in many different ways. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

### 2020 Q4 Nominations

#### Batuhan Osman Taskay 

I, Taha Hamad, propose Batuhan Osman Taskaya be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his remarkable contributions to the Python community in different fields. Although him being a high school student, he is one of the most active contributors to the CPython project with over 100+ PRs (85+ merged, 20+ awaiting) (as can be seen from the Github UI) and an active triager on the bug tracker. He has a special interest over the AST module, and he is continuously working on improving and extending that. Also, he is a member of the tracker migration team for PEP 581/588. Additionally to the core Python itself, he is the author of many different static analysis tools (including the [InspectorTiger](./InspectorTiger.html)) and regular contributor of others. Current co-maintainer of the most used external Python parser (with over 6 million downloads just from the previous month) that is dependant by Jedi, IPython, and many more.

From his record, it can be seen as he is a very active speaker on different events like FOSEM\'19/\'20 and [EuroPython](../../conferences/europython/EuroPython)\'19. The concept of these talks is mostly about discovering and hacking the internals of the CPython. As someone who seems like sharing information, he has 3 different blogs. The main one is a blog that is dedicated to ASTs and Python, and the second/third one is his personal blog about advanced Python in Turkish/English. He also organizes free Python trainings locally in Turkey, and advocation about Python in public events. As a community work, he is also one of the founding members of [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Turkey and a member of the talk selection committee. The first event of that organization is going to happen this September for the first time in Turkey. Besides that [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon), while in this coronavirus crisis, he is part of Virtual [PyIstanbul](./PyIstanbul.html) meetup, which is a weekly event that targets all Turkish speaking Pythonistas and happens every week without an exception.

#### Roy Hyunjin Han 

I, Salah Ahmed, propose that Roy Hyunjin Han be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Roy is a personal hero.

### 2020 Q1 Nominations 

#### Anthony Sottile 

I, Hugo van Kemenade, propose that Anthony Sottile be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to significant contributions to the Python community, by building and maintaining many productivity tools. For example, for creating pre-commit and pyupgrade, as a core developer of pytest and tox, a maintainer of Flake8, amongst dozens of other tools.

*supporting member up to Nov 2019*

#### Ng Swee Meng 

I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Ng Swee Meng ([sweester@gmail.com](mailto:sweester@gmail.com)) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation

Swee Meng\'s contribution to the python community in Malaysia by being the main organizer for regular python meetups (even at times when attendance was below 10 people) even long before we had [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) MY, and was also the key person to initiate [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) MY in 2015. Hi tenacity to continue contributing by managing and evangelising for python has made [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) MY grow to be known as the biggest python conference in Malaysia, and also one of the biggest and longest continuing grass-roots led non-commercial tech conference in the country.

Swee Meng also contributes to the [SinarProject](./SinarProject.html) by writing code in python. [SinarProject](./SinarProject.html) is a civic tech initiative aiming to put accountability on governments. His evangelism on using python in this project has increased society\'s general awareness on what python is, what it can do and how it can benefit society in general.

Comparatively to other countries, members of tech societies like in Malaysia will have seemingly lesser contribution due to the general attitude towards working in technology (i.e people are more interested in selling than building stuff, and the idea of sharing like in open source conferences do not catch on easily), and because of this I believe we need to recognize and acknowledge selfless people like Swee Meng, who can be made into role-models.

*Not a PSF Member*

#### Martin Roelfs 

I \[Mauricio Moreira\] would like to nominate Martin Roelfs ([martin.roelfs@kuleuven.be](mailto:martin.roelfs@kuleuven.be)), developer of [SymFit](./SymFit.html), for the PSF Fellow Membership due to its continuous effort on building and maintaining a pythonic package for Symbolic Fit ([https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit](https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit)).

#### Britone Mwasaru 

I would like to nominate Britone Mwasaru from Mombasa,Kenya. He has been training and mentoring young people particularly girls in high schools and those who dropped out of school due to poverty in the coast region of Kenya.He is a python language expert. He has served as Director of technology at Swahilipot Hub. He has empowered so many young people to learn programming.I am one of them. I am a python language beginner.

*Not a PSF Member*

#### Serhiy Storchaka 

I, Andrew Svetlov, propose that Serhiy Storchaka be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python language (the reference CPython implementation). Hi is the Python Core Developer since 2012-12-26, behind this date Serhiy is one of the most productive contributors to the Python project. I think it deserves the fellowship.

#### Lumír Balhar 

I, Honza Javorek, propose that Lumír Balhar \<[frenzy.madness@gmail.com](mailto:frenzy.madness@gmail.com)\> be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a

\- founder and leader of the Python user group in Ostrava (since 2013) - founder and lecturer of [PyLadies](./PyLadies.html) Ostrava (since 2016, I think) - co-founder of the Python user group in Olomouc (2017) - main organizer, leader, and great motivator of the [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) CZ org team for (at least) two consequent years (2019, 2020) - organizer and host (in his own house) of yearly community Python sprints dedicated to improving what the Czech Python user group does

There are many people in the Czech Republic, who are very active in promoting Python, organizing Python events, and in overall making the world better through Python. Due to language barriers, our activities have mostly local impact, so the PSF doesn\'t have so many opportunities to hear about them. I\'d like to start with internationally recognizing the great work being done here. I decided to propose Lumír as the first Czech PSF Fellow, because he stands out in following:

\- operating in a post-industrial area of the country with high unemployment and basically no prior Python awareness and no Python companies - building a local community completely from scratch, from enthusiasts and beginners, and leading it to being so robust that it was/is able to take over and successfully deliver the Czech Python user group conference, [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) CZ (\~400 attendees, previously 2015-2016 in Brno, 2017-2018 in Prague, both being major cities with abundance of Python software companies and volunteers) - being persistent in his volunteering contributions for many years, seemingly without any burnouts, always spreading good mood and attitude - being very humble in accepting any praise, perhaps not even realizing the sheer amount of good he has added to the world

*Not a PSF Member*

#### Marco Rougeth 

I, Mário Sérgio, propose that Marco Rougeth should be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community. For the past year, he has coordinated the translation of Python documentation to Portuguese language, not only promoting more people to contribute, but also creating tools that help the work of those who want to help. The efforts include coordinating embassadors to organize sprints on local events, lightining talks, blog posts and even a bot that sends strings to be translated via Telegram. Marco was in the organization of several events, including 2 Pycon Brazil. He was also the creator of Caipyra, a conference that, in 2016, started the efforts of a local community that eventually ended on the Pycon Brazil being help on the same city in 2019. He also was a key organizer of this Pycon Brazil 2019, helping the organization from afar (Dublin). A work that was of extremely importance when the current organizer had to leave the conference due to health issues. Also, for the past 4 years, he has done a silent job as a advisor on the Python Brazil Association, engaging on the efforts of keeping the Brazil\'s community development. Most of this work has happened under the shadows, as many of our amazing community efforts, but it is my personal believe that he has done enough to be a fellow of PSF.

I, Katuri Charles, propose that Humphrey Butau be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as a founding member and chairman of the Zimbabwe Python User Group. He has endeavored in bringing the use of Python and related technologies into all spheres of Zimbabwean Society. Through his efforts, Zimbabwe has hosted 2 Pycon Events, a Django Indaba and is on track on hosting a the third edition of Pycon in Zimbabwe. He has encouraged the ordinary Zimbabwean to take up Python Coding as a skill. A special mention of this has to be made for his participation in setting up and running Django Girls Coaching Events. His selfless dedication goes above and beyond after you take into account he has to do this in a tough economic environment(Mind you the price I paid for Pycon 2018 is now worth less than half its value than what I paid for initially). He is keeping the Python Community alive and well in Zimbabwe. The only other similar community that exists is Wordpress, but it does not come close in comparison with what Humphrey & Team have achieved.

But lets not forget, he must be one of the few people who writes code exclusively using Vi in Zimbabwe. That deserves an award in itself.

The meetup has a great mix of people: some are beginners that are in interested in learning a new skill, others are seasoned engineers that come to mingle. It\'s a beautiful community that I\'m proud to be part of, and without Grace, it wouldn\'t have existed at all. Grace is the main organizer, everyone has heard about her, she has been running this meetup for the last 9 years. This is what she does for the event:

Reaches out to potential sponsor companies to find venues to host SF Python meetups Reaches out to potential sponsor companies to find food sponsors She connects people together Even though she does not have a technical background, she strives to learn and understand technical topics to stay up to date on what\'s going on in the Python community Reaches out to meetup attendees and tries to get them involved with running the meetup, giving everyone a chance to step up. Handles all logistics for anything that may be needed Is proactive about schedule organization, responding to any request that may appear on meetup.com She is proactive when any sudden change of plan happens She reaches out to speakers that she would love to see speaking and she encourages them to speak She is the first to come and the last to leave [PyBay](./PyBay.html)

[PyBay](./PyBay.html) is the SF Python\'s regional conference. I\'ve not here to pitch [PyBay](./PyBay.html), but you should check out our lineup! it\'s pretty cool. This is what Grace does for [PyBay](./PyBay.html):

Grace invented [PyBay](./PyBay.html)! She also takes a lot of personal and financial risks to make [PyBay](./PyBay.html) succeed She finds solutions for when I or other organizers screw up and are not available She pushes to collaborate with organizations that can improve the diversity (gender, ethnicity, and social background) in the Python community.

#### Russell Keith-Magee (elected 2017) 

I, Katie [McLaughlin](./McLaughlin.html), propose that Russell Keith-Magee be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as, and not limited to:

- 12 year (and counting) veteran of the Django core development team

- 5 years (2011-2015) President of the Django Software Foundation

- 5 years (2013-2017, and counting) Core Organiser of [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) AU

- Significant contributions to the implementation of CPython on mobile

- BDFN (2013-present) of [BeeWare](./BeeWare.html), which on top of its technical goal of providing Python on all the platforms, serves as an incubator for first time FOSS/Python contributors

- recipient of the 2015 Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize

#### Cristoph Gohlke 

I, Martin Gfeller, like to nominate Cristoph Gohlke ([http://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/)) of Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine as PSF fellow. Christoph\'s repository of compiled Python packages ([http://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/pythonlibs/](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)) makes using Python on the Windows 64-bit much easier, and feasible for those without compiling skills. This contribution to the ecosystem shows technical excellence and dedication to keep all packages up to date. By making Python 3 version of packages available since quite some time, he also helped transition to Python 3 for Windows users. I believe his work is widely used, but not widely acclaimed, so in my opinion, he deserves recognition for this very valuable service. I had never a need to contact him, because the latest packages are always compiled and already there as soon as I have a need.

#### Manuel Kaufmann (elected 2017) 

I, Johanna Sanchez, propose Manuel Kaufmann to be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python communities in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) with the project Argentina in Python ([https://argentinaenpython.com](https://argentinaenpython.com)).

Manuel Kaufmann has organized more than 50 events to promote and share knowledge about Python programming at different audience levels from beginner to advanced. Some of these events are registered in the \"Past Events\" section ([https://argentinaenpython.com/eventos/#eventos-pasados](https://argentinaenpython.com/eventos/#eventos-pasados)).

Dusty booked speakers like Larry Hastings, Lukasz Langa, Jack Diederich, Carlos Guestrin, and several founders of successful Python-using Seattle startups.

#### Peter Inglesby (elected 2017) 

Peter has served the UK Python community through his extraordinary efforts to ensure the continuity of the [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) UK conference. Under his tenure, the size of the conference has grown continuously as has the team of voluntary organisers.

#### Daniele Procida (elected 2017) 

Daniele has served the Python community through his sustained contributions to [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) and [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) conferences around the world as an organiser, speaker, mentor and teacher.

As the conference director for [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) UK, he has overseen continuous growth in participation and has used that experience to help other conferences in their efforts to bring Python to a wider audience. A notable example is his work over three years to organise, establish and nurture [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) Namibia to the point where it is now self-sustaining.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise [DjangoCon](./DjangoCon.html) Europe 2015 but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup ([PyDiff](./PyDiff.html)) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded \"Don\'t be afraid to commit\" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier [PyCon](../../conferences/pycon/PyCon) organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
