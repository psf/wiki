There is also `virtualenvwrapper`{.backtick} that extends `virtualenv`{.backtick} to make it easier to work with multiple virtualenvs:

- Docs: [http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/)

The ability is also included in Python 3.3 through [PEP 405](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/).
