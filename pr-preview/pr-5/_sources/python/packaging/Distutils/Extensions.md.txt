This page is intended to be a repository of extensions for your \"setup.py\". Also, it is a place to exchange practical experience with writing such extensions, or asking questions regarding the internal workings of distutils (which are underdocumented, if you don\'t count the source itself). Also, you might find a solution for a certain problem you have with one of your packages.
