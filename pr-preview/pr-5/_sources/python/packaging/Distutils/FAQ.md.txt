## Distutils FAQ 

### General Questions 

#### Can you use distutils (i.e., your setup.py file) to \'\'\'un\'\'\'install a given package? 

Unfortunately, no. There is a [proposal](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/Proposals/UninstallCommand) for this, and this would be a useful feature to have though\... However, the KDE group has written a [wrapper](http://www.simonzone.com/software/pykdeextensions/en/distutils-uninstall.html) for distutils that adds a simple uninstall command.
