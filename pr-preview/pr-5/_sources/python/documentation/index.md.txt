# Documentation

These pages cover the tools and coordination efforts behind Python's official documentation. If you are looking for the actual Python docs, head to [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/). What you will find here instead is information about how those docs get written, what tools are used to build them, and how the documentation team organized its work.

## Documentation Overview

- [Documentation](Documentation) — landing page with links to the official Python docs (tutorial, language reference, standard library)

## Coordination

- [DocsCoordination](DocsCoordination) — coordination hub for the Python Documentation Team, including FAQs, task lists, and committer info
