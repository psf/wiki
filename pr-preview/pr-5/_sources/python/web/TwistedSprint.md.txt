## Twisted Sprint 

Twisted is too big and there are too many small groups of people who want to work on different things for a \"Twisted Sprint\" to be meaningful. There will be several mini-sprints involving improvements to the Twisted code base and related projects.

### Potential mini-sprints 

This is only a list of possibilities; if you can think of anything else that might belong here, or if you definitely plan on organizing your own Twisted mini-sprint, put it up here.

- **The 2.0 release:** for planning and explaining details of Twisted\'s future architecture.

- **Twisted.web2:** help with an enlightened rewrite of Twisted\'s HTTP server and client

- **Nevow:** a powerful new templating and rendering engine for use with (or without) Twisted web servers

- **[LivePage](./LivePage.html):** bi-directional, realtime calling between Python in the backend and [JavaScript](./JavaScript.html) in the front-end; enhance API available to Python to manipulate the browser, and add SSL support.
