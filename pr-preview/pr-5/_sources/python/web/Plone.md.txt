There\'s a lot to tell about Plone.

\"Plone is a ready-to-run [content management system](../archive/content%20management%20system) that is built on the powerful and free [Zope](Zope) [application server](./application(20)server.html).\" So says the \"[What is Plone?](http://plone.org/about/plone/)\" page of the [Plone Web site](http://plone.org). Wikipedia also [has plenty to say](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone_(content_management_system)).

A [PloneSprint](PloneSprint) is frequently scheduled\--half-a-dozen times annually? There are local user group meetings, annual conferences, \...

Plone is particularly prominent in Latin America, Europe, \...

Plone progress is managed in terms of [PLIP](http://plone.org/documentation/glossary/plip)s and [roadmap](http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap)s.
