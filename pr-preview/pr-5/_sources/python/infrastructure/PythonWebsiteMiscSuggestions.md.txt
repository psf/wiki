Here we develop some ideas for enhancements or changes to the beta.python.org site. As ideas get clearer we may add them to the tickets.

1\. Create a visual distinction (diff color/size/etc.) between the \"site title\" (The Official Python Programming Language Website) and the first heading (What is Python?). - ToddG

2\. Any chance of moving the \"Using Python for\...\" box farther up the page? I think that will be a high-traffic link\[s\], and not just cause I mentioned it a year or two ago ![;-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile4.png%20";-)") . - ToddG

3\. No specific suggestion, just a pointer for some ideas: [http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/current-style.cfm](http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/current-style.cfm) - Shalabh

4\. The current site has too much emphasis on Zope. -Shalabh

5\. Try this experiment - how much text on how many pages does a new user have to read to find out that the Cheese Shop and Vaults of Parnassus are the two main repositories of contributed software. Contributed software is one of \*the\* most useful resources. - Shalabh

6\. The Download \> Contributed Software link tells me \'How to Contribute Software\'. -Shalabh

7\. The Success Stories page repeats stories to make it big. Also the organization is unclear - it starts out alphabetical but it\'s not really. Or maybe that\'s because different header styles look identical. Just a simple list would be easier to browse. -Shalabh

8\. I like the content of the front page, but I think most of it should be moved to the About page. Once read by a first timer it has not much use and people really want to see what is happening now. So the news should be moved up. -Shalabh
