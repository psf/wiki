# PythonWebsite/Learning/Top

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

:::: 
### Goals

This is a micro-site to direct new users to hand-picked Python resources so they can figure out what Python is and how to learn it.

- Site must have an attractive and text-light design. \* To this end, no list will have more than 5-6 items.
- Site must either not require much ongoing maintenance, or must be maintable in some collective way (a CMS; a wiki; etc.).

::: 
#### Non-goals

- Completeness: it\'s impossible to link to everything.
- How Python is developed: this microsite is aimed at beginners, who don\'t need that sort of information)
