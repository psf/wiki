# Libraries & Tools

A mixed bag of pages about Python libraries, tools, hosting, and community organizations. This section is smaller and more eclectic than the others -- you will find everything from XML processing libraries to serialization guides to the Indian Python Software Society's bylaws. Not all of it fits neatly into a single category, which is why it ended up here.

## Libraries and Serialization

- [4Suite](4Suite) -- XML/XSLT processing library for Python
- [UsingPickle](UsingPickle) -- guide to Python's pickle module for object serialization, with examples
- [UsingPickle subpages](UsingPickle/index) -- additional pickle topics including renaming modules during unpickling
- [HierConfig](HierConfig) -- proposal for hierarchical configuration in Python, going beyond ConfigParser's two-level model

## Applications and Hosting

- [AppsWithPythonScripting](AppsWithPythonScripting) -- list of C/C++ applications that embed Python as a scripting or automation language
- [PythonHosting](PythonHosting) -- directory of web hosting providers that support Python

## Community

- [IPSS](IPSS) -- the Indian Python Software Society
- [IPSS subpages](IPSS/index) -- IPSS organizational documents (bylaws, minutes, resolutions)
- [IPSSCommittee](IPSSCommittee) -- office bearers of IPSS
- [ACC](ACC) -- the Afpy Computer Camp, a Python hacking weekend
