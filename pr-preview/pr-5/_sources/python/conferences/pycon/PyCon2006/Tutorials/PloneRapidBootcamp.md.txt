Plone is a leading open source content management system used for managing internets, intranets, and extranets in many environments.

In this tutorial, Burton walks through creating a straightforward intranet or internet site using Plone, including:

\- Understanding the advantages and strengths of Plone

\- Creating new, structured content types

\- Creating and deploying different workflows

\- Scripting your site using Python

\- Useful add-on products for Plone for additional out-of-the-box functionality

No prior Plone (or Zope) experience is required. Some Python experience will be beneficial, but not required.
