## Python AST BOF 

The Python bytecode compiler will sport a new abstract syntax in Python 2.5. The AST will provide an interface between the interpreter and Python programs, which can inspect or modify the AST. The purpose of the BOF is to discuss uses of the AST and to define APIs for sharing the AST between Python and C.
