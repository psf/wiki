PyConTX2006 needs your help! Volunteers at the registration desk will help register conference goers, give out conference materials, and provide information. If you\'d like to help out, please add your name to the schedule below for the hours you intend to volunteer. If you change your mind later on be sure to remove your name, so that we\'ll know when we need replacements. If you only want to volunteer for half an hour please feel free to change the time increments; currently the assumption is you\'re volunteering for a full hour.

Filling empty slots is most important, but we need three people at the desk Friday morning. Later on one person per time slot will do.

Here\'s the [talks schedule](http://www.python.org/pycon/2006/schedule.html) and the [list of talks with abstracts](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2006/Talks). We also need volunteer [session chairs](SessionChairs).

You may also send email to [David Goodger](mailto:goodger@python.org), the volunteer coordinator. There\'s no need to confirm; I\'m automatically informed of changes to this page.
