### Background 

The second annual [PyCon community conference](http://www.pycon.org/dc2004), [PyConDC2004](PyConDC2004), took place on 24-26 March 2004 at George Washington University\'s Cafritz Conference Center in Washington, DC. This was a low-cost community-organized conference. There were four days of sprinting on various projects before the con, from March 20 to March 23; see [SprintPlan2004](./SprintPlan2004.html) - as an opportunity to see [ExtremeProgramming](../../people/ExtremeProgramming) in action, the [PyCon](PyCon) sprint was said to have been a good place to start.
