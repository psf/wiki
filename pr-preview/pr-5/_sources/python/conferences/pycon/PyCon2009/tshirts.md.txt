We are considering a supplementary print run for 2009 PyCon T-shirts, for those who ought to have received a T-shirt but didn\'t. It will have to be a different process (one-off, via CafePress or similar) because the set-up cost of an other full print run is prohibitive.

The order will be placed at the beginning of May 2009, so please add your info by the end of April.
