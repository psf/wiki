[PyCon2010 Organizer\'s Planning is here](../PyCon2010/Organizers_Meetings).

**Next meeting**: Tuesday, March 25, at 19:00 UTC (2PM Eastern, 1PM Central, 12PM Mountain, 11AM Pacific).

**Update:** Some people are already on-site, others are on their way, so there won\'t be a formal meeting. But some people will be online.

Meetings will be held every week on Tuesday.

Meetings are held via IRC. We use the \'#pycon\' channel on irc.freenode.net. [Connection details (instructions) here](./PyCon(2f)Organizers_Meetings_Connection_Details.html).

There is a [\"PyCon Planning\" Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=og3ea7a3ov1tb3e18qppkd4ev8%40group.calendar.google.com&mode=MONTH). If you want write access, ask David Goodger (or just ask on [the pycon-organizers list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers)).
