### PyOhio open space

Notes (mostly questions) jottted down during the PyOhio planning huddle held as an open-space at PyCon 2009.
:::

::: 
### Location

> - Will they allow Wearable Python to come & sell?
> - Rooms - enough Open Spaces? Break up main hall? Need a report
> - OSU\'s policy on bringing in pizza, etc.? (I believe I discussed this with John L. earlier and it was OK, but will confirm)
> - Microsoft has a large Columbus office - perhaps it would be available for other (pre-conference?) activities
:::

::: 
### Offices

> - Food Coordinator
> - Sponsorship Chair
> - Publicity - Sarah D.
> - Lodging Coordinator - William McVey (will gather hotel info for attendees)
> - Photographer
> - After-party Coordinator
:::

::: 
### Publicity

> - Hooray to Sarah D.
> - Put together a \"PR package\" with brouchure, blog badge, poster\...
> - Publicize through ACM and IEEE - both adult and student chapters
> - Arrange talks at local meetings of other groups to publicize PyOhio & Python ( a Speakers\' Bureau? ). Make a \"Python for PHP programmers\" talk. Bring Jython to the Java User Groups.
> - Make screencasts that include a PyOhio \"ad\"
> - Spread word through EdgeCase, eRubyCon - & get advice from Joe O\'Brian
> - Tech Columbus
> - Arrange a Pylons evangelism sprint
> - We already have a Twitter feed. Should we get a LinkedIn group, too?
:::

::: 
### Sponsorship

> - AGI was our primary sponsor last year - hopefully they\'ll repeat
> - Excellent possibility of Microsoft Sponsorship. Could we also make use of MS\'s large Columbus building?
> - Far from certain, but Oracle Technical Network may sponsor
> - We need a sponsor prospectus - see those for PyCon, CodeMash for examples
:::

::: 
### Tasks

> - Call For Propoals (generic)
> - Later - targeted call for specific talk types
:::

::: 
### Activities

> - A Beginners\' Track
> - Balance of open-spaces, sprints, traditional talks? A full day of open-spaces? Probably better to mix - give nobody an excuse to skip a day
> - After-party - still very undetermined. (What about a trip to the zoo?)
> - A GiveCamp? (sprinting to produce product(s) for nonprofit/good cause)
> - CREM - Matt Arnold\'s conference-powering software, useful for scheduling
> - Keynotes?

Photography - We should make sure to take & publish photos this year. They\'re good for reminiscing and for 2010 publicity.

Fluffy, the world\'s largest python, lives at the Columbus Zoo. How can we capitalize on this? A live FluffyCam? Can she be our mascot?
