[coala](http://coala-analyzer.org/) is an easy to use code analysis tool that works for [a lot of languages](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/wiki/Supported-languages) and can also automatically fix stuff. *We will*:

- Help you setting up *code analysis for all languages in your project*.

- Help you *writing own analysis routines for your special needs*.

- Implement *support for a language you think is missing*.

- Help *newcomers* with any kind experience to *get started contributing to coala*. Opportunities vary from organizational and documentation work to solving challenging software architectural problems and writing some great code.

**There will be a mini conference happening as well.**

We will have some lightning talks, possibly talks and/or workshops from various community members.

Some coala members will be around right from the start of the sprints. (9:30) If you\'re a fellow sprinter we\'d love to help you set up coala for yor project, maybe we can make a small coala team go a round to the other projects helping them if they\'re interested.
