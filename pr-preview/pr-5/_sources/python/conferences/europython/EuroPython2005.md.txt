## Sprints 

There is room for arranging sprints from Thursday 30 June to Sunday 3 July. By special arrangement, it is possible to have sprints before the conference and sprints that extend beyond 3 July. You can even have sprints in the downstairs cafeteria area during the conference.

If you plan to arrange a sprint, please send a mail to [europython@python.org](mailto:europython@python.org) with a description of the sprint as well. We are going to need volunteers to help with some logistical issues.

## Accomodation 

Questions, hints and tips about where to stay, and requests for sharing.

**Question:** Is it possible to sleep at the university on air mattress and sleeping bag? This would be a nice and cheap alternative for poor students. Furthermore, this could provide a quite nice working atmosphere in the night. Is it possible to get a room for that purpose?

**Response:** No, it is strictly forbidden to stay overnight in any location within the university. There are nightguards ensuring that this policy is followed.

## BBQ 

We are planning a BBQ Sunday evening at the SGS Veckobostäder. This is an informal affair, with the target time of 7PM. However, people might gather beforehand. The BBQ pits are in the middle of the SGS complex, near the \'320\'s.

If you are interested, please email Aiste Kesminaite (aiste at pov dot lt) or Paul Everitt (paul at zope-europe dot org) and tell us what time you plan to arrive.

Map for getting to SGS. The Pit is in the center of the area.
