## EuroPython 2007 

[EuroPython]() 2007 will take place in Vilnius, Lithuania from Monday 9th July to Wednesday 11th July 2007.

Information for participants is available on the [EuroPython2007](../EuroPython2007) page. Sprints are on the page [EuroPython2007Sprints](../EuroPython2007Sprints), for those of you looking in the wrong place. ![;-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile4.png%20";-)")

If you merely attended the conference in previous years or are merely interested in attending future conferences, this might not be the right place for you. However, you might want to become involved in helping out with the organisation of future conferences as well: something that is definitely encouraged!
