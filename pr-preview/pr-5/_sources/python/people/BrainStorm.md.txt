# Python and Databases Brainstorm 

## Pamphlet 

This is where we need to settle on what to cover in the flyer. We need to keep it concise because there is not much room. Here are the topics I think are relevant:

- *Almost* any serious program needs persistent storage of some type.

- The Python DBI gives a consistent look and feel to most databases.

- A brief example on connecting to and calling a database.

- Something about speed vs. C/C++ or Java?
