Opinionated, particularly on subjects I love (bridge, software design, testing, William Blake, history, economics, \...), rather competent, often helpful, often given to flaming. Searching Google Groups for the thousands of usenet posts I\'ve made over the years will give a pretty accurate picture of me (in particular, it will be bafflingly complex and contradictory;-), but you may also want to see [http://www.aleax.it](http://www.aleax.it) (in both English and Italian) \-- it\'s been quite a while since I last edited that, but, that might change. For more exclusively-technical, reasonably recent content, see [https://stackoverflow.com/users/95810/alex-martelli](https://stackoverflow.com/users/95810/alex-martelli).

Current interests include Python, devops, cloud, Design Patterns, Linux, agile development, several bridge issues (Kaplan-Sheinwold, card play, statistical and combinatorial analysis of bridge-related issues, \...), a few historical ones (late Roman Republic most of all), some economics issues (particularly, these days, behavioral economics and asymmetric-information economics), high-quality movies, technical management of software development, statistics, data mining, Google App Engine, business intelligence, and more.

I currently work as Senior Staff Technical Solutions Engineer at Google, leading long-tail tech support for the Google Cloud Platform. On my homepage you\'ll find copies of several (old-ish) Python-related articles and presentations I\'ve written; many videos of my presentations can be found by searching for my name on Google Video, much else (interviews, PDFs, &c) by just searching Google. You can write me at [aleaxit@gmail.com](mailto:aleaxit@gmail.com) (can\'t guarantee I\'ll answer!-). The Python books I\'ve written for O\'Reilly are available online as part of O\'Reilly\'s \"Safari\" service, [http://my.safaribooksonline.com/](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/) \-- subscribing to Safari costs money, but the first two weeks are free, so, I suggest you give it a try, as a cheap and convenient way to read my books, among many others:-). My latest book is the third edition of Python in a Nutshell, covering 2.7 and 3.5 (plus, highlights of 3.6), co-written with my wife Anna Ravenscroft and our old friend Steve Holden (each of us is a PSF Fellow and a past winner of the Frank Willison Memorial Award for contributions to the Python community).
