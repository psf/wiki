\"doctools\" is the informal name of the Python documentation toolset. New version of this toolset is better known as [Sphinx](../documentation/Sphinx). It uses [DocUtils](../documentation/DocUtils), [reStructuredText](../archive/reStructuredText) as markup language and builds HTML and other formats out of that.

Sphinx can be found in Mercurial repository at [http://www.bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/](http://www.bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/)\
Former doctools are located in Subversion at [http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools](http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools)
