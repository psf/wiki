[George V. Reilly](http://www.georgevreilly.com/) is an experienced software developer, but a Python neophyte. He has lived in Seattle for many years. He used to work for Microsoft, mostly on the IIS development team, but is all better now. He runs Linux at home, but Windows continues to pay the bills. He is a longtime contributor to [Vim](../editors/Vim), notably the Win32 console mode port.
