As defined by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), software is [free software](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html) if it gives its users these freedoms:

- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
- The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Note that this has nothing to do with whether software can be obtained [for nothing or at no cost](ZeroPrice). A [Free Software](FreeSoftware) program (just like a non-free program) might be distributed to different people or at different times for various different prices, including [a price of zero](ZeroPrice). A program is [Free Software](FreeSoftware) if its users have the freedoms listed above, regardless of what monetary price was paid.

Software distributed under the Python License (including Python itself) is [Free Software](FreeSoftware) and is often distributed [at no cost](ZeroPrice).
