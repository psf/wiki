Love working with Jython in Tomcat. Learn more about it by checking out [JythonServlet](http://jywiki.sourceforge.net/index.php?JythonServlet). I like to use the [CubicTemp](CubicTemp) template along with it for my templating needs. Really nice. The [modified cubictemp.py](attachments/AshishShrestha/cubictemp.py "modified cubictemp.py") is available here. Use this one instead of the original one to use it with Jython 2.1 You need to first get the original files from the site. Disclaimer: I haven\'t done intensive testing. It does what I need and I am happy with it. If you have any problem do let me know.

My [JythonTutorial]( "Upload new attachment "jython.tut.zip"") for those who already understand basic programming! Starts with python and goes on to do jython!
