## Donovan Preston 

I have been using Python on the mac for about four years now and really enjoy it. Early on, I wrote an IBCarbon wrapper which lets you use Carbon nibs created with Interface Builder in your Python apps. It is now included with Python. I also wrote [../CarbonEvent](./CarbonEvent.html) support so you can write Carbon apps in Python which take advantage of this improved event loop mechanism on Mac OS X. Lately, I have been less interested in Carbon since many more people are using Mac OS X now. I have been following PyObjC development with great interest and am happy to say it is now ready for use building industrial strength Mac OS X applications. I am interested in audio, graphics, and collaborative programming techniques. I recently wrote some code which uses [../CoreAudio](./CoreAudio.html) to play sound on Mac OS X, linked from the [../CoreAudio](./CoreAudio.html) page.

I am also the author of Nevow, a web templating framework in pure python.
