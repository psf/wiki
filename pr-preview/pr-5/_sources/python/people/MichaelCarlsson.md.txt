## Michael Carlsson 

Hi,

I signed up to correct some links on the [pycon2008 tutorial](../packaging/buildout/pycon2008 tutorial).

I\'m at the moment (2013) employed at [DBC A/S](http://www.dbc.dk) where I work as a developer. Coding mostly Drupal (PHP) but I am looking into using Python for creating and managing jobs at a Jenkins server to make building and testing easier. Hopefully I will continue to use Python for various purposes such as hacking, testing and pure fun. ![;-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile4.png ";-)")
