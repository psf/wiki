I\'m arriving at Dulles around 17:00 on Saturday the 19th for the [PyConDC2005/Sprints](../conferences/pycon/PyConDC2005/Sprints), but I\'m not sure whether I\'d rather work on a del.icio.us parcel for Chandler (although the [ChandlerSprint2005](./ChandlerSprint2005.html) starts on Monday, I think) or the [TwistedSprint](../web/TwistedSprint), perhaps [LivePage](./LivePage.html) in particular. Really the [PyPySprint](../implementations/PyPySprint) sounds appealing, but I\'m (a) more interested in Jython at the moment (although there doesn\'t seem to be a [JythonSprint](JythonSprint), and Brian Zimmer tells me he can\'t make it) and (b) it looks pretty full and furthermore (c) I\'m arriving late in the day, so I\'ll miss all the introductory tutorial stuff.

Comments are welcome.
