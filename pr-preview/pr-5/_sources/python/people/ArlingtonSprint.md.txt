## Sprint Accomplishments: December 16, 2006 

- 21 students from 3 area high schools participated in an all day intro to Python workshop. Their level of enthusiasm and stamina was truly inspiring, since even after learning all day from 9 am to 6 pm, several of the participants had to be kicked out of the lab at 6 pm.

## Sprint Accomplishments: November 18, 2006 

- Fixed the score system bugs and figured out the journal hashing problem that occured when Data.fs was transfered between different machines.

- [AndrewKuchling](AndrewKuchling) worked on translating a [PyZone archive](http://effbot.org/zone/pyzone-archive.htm) into a FAQ suitable for python.org, and on two bugfixes for Jython.

- David Muffley, [MatthewGallagher](MatthewGallagher), and [JamesHancock](JamesHancock) got pacman running under gasp ([https://launchpad.net/products/gasp](https://launchpad.net/products/gasp)).

## Sprint Accomplishments: October 21, 2006 

- [JeffreyElkner](JeffreyElkner) worked on [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python](http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html/index.html), adding [TkInter](TkInter) exercises.

## Sprint Accomplishments: September 23, 2006 

- [AndrewKuchling](AndrewKuchling) worked on using a new templating system, [rest2web](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/), for the python.org website. The result is still preliminary, but promising.

- [FredDrake](FredDrake) spent most of his time trying to figure out how to better deal with the documentation sections on www.python.org; there\'s more to be done, but the section for Python 2.5 now matches the style of the rest of the site.

- Fred and Andrew spent some time reviewing the issue trackers being considered to replace the trackers on [SourceForge](SourceForge).

- [FredDrake](FredDrake) started going over the review comments Kevin Cole provided on the [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/doc/doc.html), most of which were produced at the previous Arlington sprint.

- [JeffreyElkner](JeffreyElkner) worked on [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python](http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html/index.html), fixing errors found by readers and adding exercises.

- David Muffley and George Paci worked on [Gasp](http://dc.ubuntu-us.org/projects/gasp/), adding unit tests and fixing bugs.

## Sprint Accomplishments: July 28-30, 2006 

- [AndrewKuchling](AndrewKuchling) added many, many examples to the library reference.

- Kevin Cole started a detailed review of the Python Tutorial.

- [FredDrake](FredDrake) removed the `xmlcore` package, leaving only the `xml` package found in previous releases. Tests were added that check for some of the problems that provoked the removal. This resolves (at least) [1511497](http://bugs.python.org/issue1511497 "SF") and [1513611](http://bugs.python.org/issue1513611 "SF"), and obsoletes [1504456](http://bugs.python.org/issue1504456 "SF").

- Fixed [1193966](http://bugs.python.org/issue1193966 "SF") (weakref documentation cleanup for extension types).

- Various minor documentation cleanups.

- Tom Hoffman and Alan Elkner refactored Tom\'s tinyzis project, removing redundant code and adding functional tests. ZIS (Zone Integration Server) is part of the Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) with will eventually be used to allow [SchoolTool](SchoolTool) to talk to moodle.

- Interns William, Will, Robbie, and Linda worked on the skilldriver package which allows the creations of assignments that utilise competencies.

- [JeffreyElkner](JeffreyElkner) completed updating the 1st 9 chapters of the second edition of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python ([http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html](http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html)).

- [PaulCarduner](PaulCarduner) and Eldar Omuraliev enhanced the journal package so each student can have a separate journal for each of their sections. A new [CanDo](CanDo) skin was also made for overriding schooltool\'s actions menu layout. Work began on a more intuitive competencies editor with flexible tree layout.

- Competency Gradebook was enhanced with javascript cell navigation
