## Mike Taylor 

I have worked on the commercial 3D application [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/maya) for the last 12+ years. I have recently added Python support to that product by embedding the CPython interpreter. I have been using Python since about version 1.1, and can now apply that to my main work.

I have experience targeting the JVM platform with a scripting language, although it is a few years back. During the 2007 Python Conference I got stuck in Texas for an extra day and got mugged by some Jython developers looking for volunteers:-)

I am located in a forest near Deep River, Ontario in Canada. I do my work remotely via a satellite dish on my roof. It is a good life.
