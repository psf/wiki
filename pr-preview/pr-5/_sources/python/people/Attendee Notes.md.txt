Can you add a link to the [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=78464525183) for PyCon\'09 in Social Software section?

The Hyatt is charging \$10 per day for WiFi access in the rooms! The pycon organizers have provided free Wifi in the conference area (thank you) which seems to be working well so if you can live with no WiFi in your room use the pycon APs.

The Hyatt room service is T-Mobile hotspot so if you are already a subscriber access is free. If not, buy a day pass directly from T-Mobile for \$6 instead of from the hotel and save \$4/day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Driving and tolls: In Illinois cash tolls are twice as expensive as tolls paid electronically via I-Pass or EZ-Pass transponders. The main interstates converging on the hotel from the north and south (I-294) and northwest (I-90) are toll roads. I-90 from Chicago is not a toll road.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For attendees arriving at O\'Hare, the hotel told me that one should use the \"center exit 2\" presumably from baggage claim, for ground transportation, and look for a red Crown Plaza shuttle. It runs every 15 minutes. The Crown Plaza phone number is 847/671-6350.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Crowne Plaza hotel no longer offers free wireless access to Priority Club members; that service has been discontinued. I confirmed this with the front desk upon arrival. According to the front desk, wireless access has been set up with the hotel for \"our group\"; I suppose that should be up on the Attendee Notes, unless the front desk was thinking of another group?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \"getting around Chicago\" page lists 1-800-TAXICAB. I called that number and was told that Rosemont Taxi ((847) 827-0110) has an exclusive contract with the city/village of Rosemont such that the 1-800-TAXICAB dispatcher can\'t dispatch any taxis for \'\'pickup\'\' in Rosemont. I called Rosemont Taxi, their taxi arrived within five minutes, and the driver was courteous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those international travellers arriving at O\'Hare Terminal 5, the hotel shuttle bus picks up outside the terminal on stand 27.
