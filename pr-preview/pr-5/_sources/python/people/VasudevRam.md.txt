[Vasudev Ram (Dancing Bison Enterprises)](https://vasudevram.github.io) is an independent software consultant, developer, trainer and writer, and a Fellow of the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf). He is the creator of [xtopdf](https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#xtopdf), a toolkit for creation of PDF from other data formats, [PDFXMLRPC](https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#PDFXMLRPC), a toolkit and a pair of applications for client-server creation of PDF from text over the Internet, and [PySiteCreator](https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#PySiteCreator), a tool for creating Web pages by writing them entirely in Python. All those products are written in Python. But Vasudev is not - written in Python, that is ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png ":-)") He is not sure what language he is written in (if any). If interested, you could try asking the Great Developer in the Sky.
