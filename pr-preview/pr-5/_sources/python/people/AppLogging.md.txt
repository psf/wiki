Python has a standard [logging](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) module modeled after [Apache log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j) - the standard logging system for Java. Here we gather additional information about logging in Python in general that is missing from the docs.

- [LoggingPackage](LoggingPackage) page contains discussions about `logging`{.backtick} module features.

- [http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4py/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4py/) is another log4j port to Python.

- [http://packages.python.org/Logbook/](http://packages.python.org/Logbook/) replacement for the standard library's logging module.

- [Lithoxyl](http://lithoxyl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), rock-solid, action-oriented logging, metrics, and instrumentation framework, built as a Pythonic alternative to the Log4J clones.
