- I am currently looking for volunteers that are willing to teach more advance python lectures. The more advance topics will inclue swig, jython, XML manipulation, etc. If you are interested in volunteering, you can reach me at my ourmedia.org site. \[WWW\] [http://ourmedia.org/user/4887](http://ourmedia.org/user/4887)

  - You don\'t need any expansive video equipment to record yourself. If you are using linux, the voice is recorded in Audacity, the screen capture is done in gvidcap, and the movie divx format is done is avidmux2. They are all open source and free to download at [http://www.sourceforge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net)

    If you are using windows, use [CamStudio](./CamStudio.html), it is also free (i love opensource) you can download it here [http://www.majorgeeks.com/CamStudio_d4646.html](http://www.majorgeeks.com/CamStudio_d4646.html)
