NumArray was a reimplementation of Numeric. It has been phased out in favor of [NumPy](../science/NumPy).

Its web page was [http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray](http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray) (no longer works)

[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the reimplementation of Numeric. As both developers of Numeric and Numarray have moved to [NumPy](../science/NumPy), [NumPy](../science/NumPy) is a good choice for new applications.
