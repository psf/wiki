This is my personal page\...

I like using Python, but I don\'t always get as much time to do it as I would like. There is a lot of pressure at work for me to embrace Java, so I\'m doing that as much as I can for now. Later, maybe I can inject Python into those Java projects via Jython!

My Python interests include:

- py2app - Miro uses it to make Mac OS X apps

- django - I\'d like to start using this for web apps

- Zope\'s Document Template - I use this for a couple of production web applications. I\'ve thought about switching to XSLT, but as my Python skills improve, I\'m finding that DTML works pretty well.

- [AppleScript](../platforms/MacPython/AppleScript)
