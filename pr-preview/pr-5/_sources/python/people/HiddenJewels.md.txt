# Hidden Jewels 

\"Hidden Jewels\", (for lack of a better name,) are powerful Python capabilities of general interest that people don\'t know about, even long-time Python programmers.

For example, [at a recent Python meeting in Seattle,](http://www.seapig.org/August2003Notes) few of us knew about:

- [The DocXMLRPCServer,](http://www.seapig.org/DocXMLRPCServer) which makes writing servers and clients dirt easy, and entirely self-documenting.

- [Future threads,](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/84317) which make threading so simple, you don\'t even have to know how it works.

There are likely many more like this.

Perhaps we need to rename this page to \"[CoolPythonThings](./CoolPythonThings.html)\", or something like that.
