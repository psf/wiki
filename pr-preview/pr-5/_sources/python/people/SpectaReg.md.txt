SpectaReg is an Electronic System Level (ESL) development framework provided by **PDTi** that makes memory mapped registers (aka register-maps) really easy for chip development teams. SpectaReg provides a rich and intuitive user interface for specifying register-maps, and with a mouse click dependent design, testing and documentation deliverables are generated (Verilog, [SystemVerilog](./SystemVerilog.html), VHDL, C/C++, HTML, [DocBook](./DocBook.html), DITA). Specifications are stored in the SPIRIT Consortium\'s IP-XACT XML standard and the framework is extensible using Python.
