We\'ll be providing lunch and dinner to our attendees and breakfast will be available from the micro-kitchens. Our guests will dine with us in our cafes for their meals.

## Housing - MTV 

You can book a room at The Residence Inn Palo Alto/Mountain View; ask for Google\'s corporate rate. If you\'re looking to save funds, you might consider booking a penthouse room at the property and doubling up with another attendee. [http://marriott.com/property/propertypage.mi?marshaCode=SFOMV](http://marriott.com/property/propertypage.mi?marshaCode=SFOMV)

## Security - MTV 

Badges will be provided to all attendees. Please wear them at all times.

More info: [http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html](http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html)

## Come Prepared! 

Please come prepared so we won\'t have to waste time helping everybody with their setup. Bring a laptop (preferably running Linux or OSX; we have limited svn setup experience for other systems, esp. Windows). Make sure svn is installed: [http://subversion.tigris.org/](http://subversion.tigris.org/) \-- Check [Hasans Blog Entry on subversion](http://prolificprogrammer.com/~hdiwan/blog/2006/08/02/home_subversion_repository_1.html) for help with other systems.

For Python 2.6, check out the head branch; see [http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn](http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn) (use the instructions for anonymous checkout unless you already have developer privileges).

For py3k, check out the \"py3k\" branch. Also read PEPs 3000-3999.

In either case, make sure you have at least built and tested it once so you are familiar with the process. It\'s something like \"./configure; make; make test\" in the appropriate directory. (For Py3k, half a dozen tests typically fail \-- a goal of the sprint will be to fix these.)

### Questions 

Are you guys on IRC, Google Talk, or something like that? Answer: no IRC AFAIK; some individuals can be IM\'ed in gmail chat, e.g. [gvanrossum@gmail.com](mailto:gvanrossum@gmail.com), [nnorwitz@gmail.com](mailto:nnorwitz@gmail.com).

Various [Freenode IRC](http://freenode.net/) channels appear to be unused: #py3k, #pysprint, #sprynt, etc.. I could register one if there was interest, but it\'s not strictly required. \--pfein on [irc://irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net)

I suspect #python-dev would be sufficient. \-- [SkipMontanaro](SkipMontanaro)

Chicago folks can check out #py3kchicago on Freenode. \-- Paul Smith
