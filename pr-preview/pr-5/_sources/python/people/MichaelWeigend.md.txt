I live in Witten, a city in the eastern part of the Ruhrgebiet. This is an industrial and cultural area in the west of Germany, somewhere between Cologne (big gothic cathedral) and Münster (Westfalian Peace, end of 30-Years-War 1648).

I teach informatics and chemistry at a highschool in Witten and didacticts of computer science at the University of Hagen.
