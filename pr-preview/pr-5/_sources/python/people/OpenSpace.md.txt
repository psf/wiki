# OpenSpace 

OpenSpace is essentialy a simple methodology for Emergent Conferences.

OpenSpace is essentially a simple methodology for Self Organizing conference tracks. It relies on the participation of people with a passion for the topics to be discussed. There is no preplanned list of topics only time slots and a large kick off meeting where interested participants propose topics, pick time slots and try to get folks to sign up for their talks. This is all done on newsprint on a wall allowing for an XP like organization of time slots.

A great deal of horse trading occurs to maximize attendance, sessions with similar topics merge while spontaneous conversations lead to new topics. Some people have called it a Wiki of physical meetings
