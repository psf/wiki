Um, I don\'t know if I should have put my own page up here or not. It is a convenient place to put my python code, I guess, so I\'ll probably be doing that in the near future.

# Update: 11 October 2006 

Haha. It\'s been \"years\" since I wrote the above, still no code posted; that\'s a shame. Well, nobody\'s been bugging me to remove this page, or something, so I guess I\'ll leave it until either that happens or I get around to putting some stuff up here.

## Notes 

[JAM](JAM): I think that the idea of Python \"one-liners\" is a good example of how to process multiple commands in the same line. Although this is the same as adding new lines. It is something that takes a little more creativity however, so I am neutral on this subject.
