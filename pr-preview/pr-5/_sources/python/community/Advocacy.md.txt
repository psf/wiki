  Getting Involved in Discussions
  ---------------------------------
:::

Discussions on advocating the use of Python take place on the following mailing lists:

- [General Advocacy (everyone welcome)](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/advocacy)

- [Committee to Support Usergroups](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/usergroup-advocacy)

- [Gathering of Current/Future Usergroup Leaders](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/group-organizers)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings! I\'m the [PythonAdvocacyCoordinator](PythonAdvocacyCoordinator). You can reach me via email at `<advocate AT python DOT org>`. I\'m always glad to hear ideas or corrections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Focus 

- [to support and encourage the formation of usergroups](Advocacy/UsergroupSupport)

- [to create a series of 5-minute videos introducing uses of Python](Advocacy/5MinuteVideos)

- to write whitepapers as a follow-on to the 5-minute videos

- [exploration of getting non-programmers to start with Python](Advocacy/ProgrammingForNewprogrammers)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How You Can Get Involved! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Want to help with some writing? Check out our list of whitepaper/flyer [AdvocacyWritingTasks](AdvocacyWritingTasks) or magazine [ArticleIdeas](../people/ArticleIdeas).

## Suggestions from the Community 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Identify a shirt store in Europe, to provide a more local source of Python wearables than Cafe Press.

- Help complete the remaining 15% of Python-equivalent recipes (and review the existing 85% for being current with Python 2.5) of the [Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook](http://pleac.sourceforge.net), a side-by-side comparison of algorithms in different programming languages based on the Perl Cookbook.

- Do something about python.com! Python is a great teaching language, but one of the first things a curious student is likely to do in search of more info is go to their browser and surf to www.python.com. Yikes! It is unlikely that we can get them to give up their domain name, but maybe they could be convinced to at least put up a front page with \"You are about to enter an adult site, are you 18, etc\...\" And if we were really lucky, their front page could contain \"If you are looking for info on the Python programming language, go to www.python.org\" How can we \"encourage\" them to do the right thing?

## General Notes 

Advocacy is the process of letting people know what Python is good at, and drawing them into using the language. The most effective forms of advocacy lure users to the language by impressing them with results, rather than brow beating or lecturing them on language design.

Published articles that answer the question \"how do I solve X with Python?\" are a good way to get people interested.

One goal for writing articles might be to develop a library of How-Tos for Python. Much information exists, but it has not been collected for convenient access from python.org (or another central location), and there are certainly gaps in covering key strengths of Python.

A collection of [Python Success Stories](http://python.org/about/success) already exists. These are also useful, usually by helping engineers convince their bosses that Python is worthy of attention. But success stories tend to be lean on \"how-to\" style information, so they do not offer a convenient path to get new users working with Python.

Since the goal for advocacy is to highlight Python\'s strengths, [this Key Strengths list](http://wingware.com/python) may be useful.

## Print and Online Magazines that Accept Technical Articles 

We would like to focus on those magazines outside the Python community, in order to reach those who don\'t know about us. Also there are many magazines that accept press releases that do not accept articles. We need those that welcome articles.

- [Linux Journal](http://linuxjournal.com) [Author Guidelines](http://www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/author/index)

- [Dr. Dobbs Journal](http://www.ddj.com) [Author Guidelines](http://www.ddj.com/authors.htm)

- [Byte Magazine](http://byte.com) (no guidelines found; may not accept non-staff material)

- [MacTech Magazine](http://www.mactech.com) [Author Guidelines](http://www.mactech.com/editorial/writersguide.html)

- [O\'Reilly Python Dev Center](http://www.onlamp.com/python/) \-- Inside Python community in a sense but O\'Reilly gets a lot of exposure.

- [Infoworld](http://www.infoworld.com/)

- [Artima Developer](http://www.artima.com/)

- [Intelligent Enterprise](http://www.intelligententerprise.com/)

## Electronic Magazines that Accept Technical Articles 

- [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com) [Author Guidelines](http://arstechnica.com/site/styleguide.ars)
