[python-mode](https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode) (python-mode.el) is a major mode for editing Python with the [EmacsEditor](EmacsEditor). It is a separate mode from the Python mode included in GNU Emacs, known as python.el, and can be installed as an alternative.

python-mode is available on MELPA as [python-mode](https://melpa.org/#/python-mode).

The EmacsWiki page [ProgrammingWithPythonModeDotEl](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ProgrammingWithPythonModeDotEl "EmacsWiki") has information on how to install, configure and add shortcuts keys. An example how to setup a complete IDE around python-mode was shown at [EuroPython 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZ7szFuz18If).
