As of late 2019, Python 3.x is the current version of the language and early Python 3.0 resources and planning are out of date. Python 3 development work is done with the main project tools and systems. [The most recent version of this page from 2008](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Py3kDeprecated?action=recall&rev=19) is largely of historical interest.
