Replace the stack based virtual machine with a register based machine. This would be a fairly large project but could likely be mostly completed in a summer. The resulting performance increase would be around 10%.

Maybe it would be more interesting to work on the Parrot side of things, which is also a register based VM, but will include support for other languages than Python (allowing for cool things like exchanging objects/functionality in Perl, Python and PHP).

There\'s been a recent [discussion on register-based approaches](http://tinyurl.com/register-interp).
