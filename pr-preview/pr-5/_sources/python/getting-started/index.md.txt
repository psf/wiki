# Getting Started

New to Python, or new to programming entirely? This section collects beginner-friendly guides, example programs, and practice exercises. Most of this content was written by community members over the years and reflects a range of teaching styles. The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is still the best single starting point, but the pages here fill in gaps and offer different angles.

- [Beginner's Guide](BeginnersGuide/index) -- the original community-maintained guide to getting set up and finding learning resources
- [Beginner's Guide](BeginnersGuide) -- a single-page version with installation help and first steps
- [Beginner's Guide (Chinese)](BeginnersGuideChinese) -- Python beginner guide translated into Chinese
- [Moving to Python from Other Languages](MovingToPythonFromOtherLanguages) -- what experienced programmers should know when picking up Python

## Learning by Example

- [Simple Programs](SimplePrograms) -- progressively longer code examples, from one-liners to multi-class programs
- [Simple Programs (Chinese)](SimpleProgramsChinese) -- the same graduated examples, translated into Chinese
- [Learn Python](LearnPython) -- learning Python through XML, XSLT, and other practical code samples
- [While Loop](WhileLoop) -- a focused explanation of while loops with usage patterns

## Practice and Project Ideas

- [Coding Project Ideas](CodingProjectIdeas/index) -- a curated collection of project ideas that benefit the Python community
- [Coding Project Ideas](CodingProjectIdeas) -- single-page listing of projects ranging from week-long to month-long
- [Problem Sets](ProblemSets/index) -- programming challenge sites with Python solutions and commentary
- [Problem Sets](ProblemSets) -- links to online judges and problem archives for practice
