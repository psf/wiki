## Beginner\'s Guide to Python 

Welcome to Python.

The [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) provides a good starting point if you have programmed in another language.

New to programming? Python is free and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you get started.

[Beginner\'s Guide: Chinese Translation/中文版入门](BeginnersGuideChinese)

### New to Python? 

Read [BeginnersGuide/Overview](BeginnersGuide/Overview) for a short explanation of what Python is.

### Getting Python 

Next, install the Python 3 interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac and Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3). See [BeginnersGuide/Download](BeginnersGuide/Download) for instructions to download the correct version of Python.

There are also Python interpreter and IDE bundles available, such as [Thonny](http://thonny.org). Other options can be found at [IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments](../editors/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments).

At some stage, you\'ll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at [HowToEditPythonCode](../guides/HowToEditPythonCode) for some advice and recommendations.

### Learning Python 

Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

- If you have never programmed before, see [BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers](BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) for a list of suitable tutorials.

- If you have previous programming experience, consult [BeginnersGuide/Programmers](BeginnersGuide/Programmers), which lists more advanced tutorials.

- If English isn\'t your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that\'s been translated into your language. Consult python.org\'s [list of Non-English resources](../archive/Languages).

Most tutorials assume you know how to run a program on your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, see [How do I Run a Program Under Windows](http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows).

Here are some sites that focus on beginners and offer in-browser coding:

[Please keep these links sorted alphabetically]

- [Beginners Python tutorial](https://python.land/python-tutorial) at Python Land (free)

- [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/python) (non-free)

[Outdated, Python 2! \* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) ]

- [Coding Bootcamps](https://www.coding-bootcamps.com) (non-free)

- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) (non-free)

- [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) for Python for data science. (free)

- [Genepy](https://genepy.org) interactive exercises (free, open source, no ads)

- [High School Technology Services](https://www.myhsts.org) for general Python (non-free)

- [LabEx](https://labex.io) Python Hands-on Labs (freemium)

- [Learn Python](https://aqemery.github.io/learn-python) Python basics running in the browser(free)

Once you have read a tutorial, you can browse through [Python\'s online documentation](http://docs.python.org). It includes [a tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tut/) that might come in handy, [a Library Reference](http://docs.python.org//lib/) that lists all of the modules that come standard with Python, and [the Language Reference](http://docs.python.org/ref/) for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python\'s syntax.

When you are ready to write your first program, you will need a [text editor](../editors/PythonEditors) or an [IDE](../editors/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). If you don\'t want to use Thonny or something more advanced, then you can use [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html), which is bundled with Python and supports [extensions](http://idlex.sourceforge.net).

This Python wiki also contains a page about [Python One-Liners](../guides/Powerful%20Python%20One-Liners) \-- an obscure but interesting subculture in Python.

### Need Help? 

Need help with any of this? Read [BeginnersGuide/Help](BeginnersGuide/Help) for mailing lists and newsgroups.

An interactive and free way to learn Python is to ask ChatGPT or another generative AI model for help. The Python code quality generated by AI agents has become pretty good. State-of-the-art AI models work especially well for small projects or code understanding questions.

Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see [IntroductoryBooks](../books/IntroductoryBooks) for suggested titles.

Consult [BeginnersGuide/Examples](BeginnersGuide/Examples) for small programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.

Or, if you prefer to learn Python through listening to a lecture, you can attend a training course or even hire a trainer to come to your company. Consult the [PythonEvents](../conferences/regional/PythonEvents) page to see if any training courses are scheduled in your area and the [PythonTraining](../archive/PythonTraining) page for a list of trainers.

Teachers can join the [EDU-SIG](http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/), a mailing list for discussion of Python\'s use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to university.
