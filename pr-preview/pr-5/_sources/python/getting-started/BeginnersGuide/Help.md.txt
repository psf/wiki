## Getting Help 

If you experience problems using Python, your first step should be to check the documentation.

- The [Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) describes the language and the standard modules in detail.

- Many common questions are answered in [the Frequently Asked Question lists](http://docs.python.org/faq/).

- If you suspect you\'ve discovered a bug in the Python core, search the [Python Bug Tracker](http://bugs.python.org/) to find out if it\'s already been reported.

If the documentation doesn\'t help, here\'s how to get help from real people:

- [comp.lang.python](news:comp.lang.python) Post to the Python newsgroup, renowned for its friendly and helpful atmosphere. See [the guide to Python mailing lists](https://www.python.org/community/lists/#comp-lang-python) for more information.

- [tutor mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) A moderate-volume mailing list for folks who want to ask questions while learning computer programming with Python. See [the guide to Python mailing lists](http://www.python.org/community/lists/#tutor) for more information.

- [help@python.org](mailto:help@python.org) The Python help desk. You can ask a group of knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems. See [the guide to Python mailing lists](http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help) for more information.

## Contacting the Webmaster 

**webmaster is not a Python language support channel!!!**

- The webmaster should only be contacted if you have found a problem with the python.org website such as a broken link, typographic error, or other problem.

- For such problems, also check [the github issue tracker for the website](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues)
