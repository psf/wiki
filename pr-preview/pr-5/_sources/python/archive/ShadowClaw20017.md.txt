Hey There!

As a Python programmer, I wish others to be able to learn this language as well. It\'s a great language, especially for beginners. It is my intention to do what I can to teach others more about Python and help them along their journey.

As a result, I\'ve created a Website/Blog called [CodersLegacy](https://coderslegacy.com) with a primary focus towards Teaching Python. We have a [Python section for beginners](https://coderslegacy.com/learning-the-basics) as well as an advanced section for more [experienced python learners](https://coderslegacy.com/python-advanced).

Head over to the site and begin your python journey today!
