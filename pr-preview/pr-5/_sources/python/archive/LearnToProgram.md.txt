This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).

There is a whole page devoted to people who have never programmed before: [http://www.python.org/doc/Newbies.html](http://www.python.org/doc/Newbies.html).

If you know how to program yourself, but want to teach it to others, the [SpecialInterestGroup](./SpecialInterestGroup.html) [Python in Education](http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/) might be for you.
