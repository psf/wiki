\"A page for ideas on gathering statistics about how Python is used.\"

The motivation is to help during discussions about Python where a consensus isn\'t available. Anecdotes usually fall short in that case.

Ideally, we\'d be able to break data down into various groupings, and consider both totals and percentages.

## Data Groupings 

- new development vs. stable code-bases
- categories (web, scripts, \"big data\", computation, etc.)
- \"bare metal\" vs. on top of some framework
- regional usage

## Solutions for Gathering Usage Statistics 

- data from PyPI (a.k.a. the cheeseshop)
- search results (incl. google, code search sites)
- 

## Usage Categories 

An unsubstantiated of how Python is used:

### Heavy 

- web applications
- scripting and tooling
- high-performance computation
- testing (non-Python/embedded/whatever code)

### Medium 

- 

### Light 

- games

## Other thoughts 

- Data from PyPI or google will likely not include closed-source usage.
