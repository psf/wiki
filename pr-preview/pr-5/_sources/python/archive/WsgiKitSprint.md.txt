This will be a sprint on [WSGIKit](http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGIKit), and by association [Webware](http://webwareforpython.org) and [WSGI](http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html). Really the emphasis will be on building reusable framework-neutral WSGI middleware to help replicate (and improve!) Webware\'s functionality; so you don\'t have to be interested in Webware to participate, you just have to be interested in Python web programming. (I\'ll be writing some more information about the design of WSGIKit before the sprint, and moving it to a more public repostory \-- Ian)

Discussion should take place on [webware-devel@lists.sourceforge.net](mailto:webware-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)

Please list your name and contact information (i.e., email). If you are interested but aren\'t sure if you can come, then just note that next to your name. If you are interested in
