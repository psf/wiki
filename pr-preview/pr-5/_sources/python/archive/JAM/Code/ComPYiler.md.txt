## ComPYiler 

This is a program that compiles every .py file in the Python directory. Please note that it only works if you set Python\'s directory to C:\\Python24. If you are using an older version or customized your directory choice. I am not sure what opperating systems it will work on, but I know it will work on win32.

This program is part of the [Powerful Python One-Liners](../../../guides/Powerful%20Python%20One-Liners) group. I hope to help expand the [Code](../../Code) page. Thank you for visiting this page and **HAVE A GREAT DAY!** ![:-)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png%20":-)")
