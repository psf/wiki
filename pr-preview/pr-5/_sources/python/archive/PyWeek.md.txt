PyWeek is the bi-annual Python Game Programming Challenge run at [http://pyweek.org/](http://pyweek.org/)

The PyWeek challenge:

1.  Invites entrants to write a game in one week from scratch either as an individual or in a team,
2.  Is intended to be challenging and fun,
3.  Will hopefully increase the public body of game tools, code and expertise,
4.  Will let a lot of people actually finish a game, and
5.  May inspire new projects (with ready made teams!)
