Boa Constructor is a cross platform Python IDE and wxPython GUI Builder. It offers visual frame creation and manipulation, an object inspector, many views on the source like object browsers, inheritance hierarchies, doc string generated html documentation, an advanced debugger and integrated help.

Zope support: Object creation and editing. Cut, copy, paste, import and export. Property creation and editing in the Inspector and Python Script debugging.

It is written in Python and uses the wxPython library which wraps wxWindows.

The project released through [SourceForge](https://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net), but that has been inactive since 2007. A successor project on [GitHub](https://github.com/ianBBB/boa-constructor) aims to update to Python 3 and newer wxPython.
