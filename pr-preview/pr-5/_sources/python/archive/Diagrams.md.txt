[Simplicity matters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0), that\'s why [a picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) is worth a thousand words.

Here are some tools written in Python or just open source, that will help to make your ideas and architecture accessible to the rest of the world.

- [Asciiflow](http://www.asciiflow.com/) - online editor for Ascii diagrams (Java, GWT + GAE, BSD)

- [blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/) - diagram images enerator by Takeshi Komiya (Python, Apache 2.0)

You can also draw ASCII diagrams by hand using [Far Manager (Windows, BSD)](http://farmanager.com):

1.  Shift-F4, open or create new file
2.  F11, call plugin menu
3.  D, use Draw lines plugin
4.  Shift-Arrows to draw lines and boxes
5.  F1, if you\'re lost
