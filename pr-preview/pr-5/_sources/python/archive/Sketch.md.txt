Sketch is a Free Software interactive **vector** drawing appliction. Known to run on GNU/Linux and other UNIX-compatible systems, it is a flexible and powerful tool for illustrations, diagrams and other purposes.

A somewhat unique (for a drawing program) feature of Sketch is that it is implemented almost completely in Python.
