Stephan Deibel suggested that the PSF could use some printed material to hand out at conferences. (This page overlaps the [evangelism support materials](../archive/evangelism%20support%20materials) page.)

## Brochure 

Brief introduction & overview; perhaps a single 8.5x11 page folded twice.

*The design should work for A4 size too, since that is the European standard* - SH

## Posters 

Facundo Batista suggested a big poster with a big logo and the Zen of Python.

Maybe the quick reference could be turned into a poster, too.

## CDs 

Not sure what should go on a python.org CD?

- The code, plus a copy of the web site?

- A bootable Linux distribution w/ lots of Python toys (like the [PythonCd](../psf/PythonCd)).
