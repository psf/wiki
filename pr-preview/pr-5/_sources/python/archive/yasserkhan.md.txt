**DESCRIPTION**

This is Yasser Rafiq Khan. I am a software engineering student from OIST bhopal. The **Python programming language** is getting one of the most advanced high level language these days. its really very helpful in creating your own software at various platforms. it is quite user friendly and simple to implement. i am getting into this because by learning this language i can create simple software for symbian mobile phones as this language really is the most easy way to do this. i am using ***PYTHON 2.6***. I hope, if you too are interested in doing something creative, you can have a look at this stuff. This would surely help you out. This language uses OOP concepts. It is influenced by **JAVA** also. So you can go through it. This is the most happening thing going around currently.
