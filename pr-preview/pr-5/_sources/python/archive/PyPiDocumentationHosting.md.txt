[http://pythonhosted.org/](http://pythonhosted.org/) (formerly [http://packages.python.org/](http://packages.python.org/) ) used to provide hosting for documentation for Python packages; this [is no longer the case](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/509) and Python project developers should instead use [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
