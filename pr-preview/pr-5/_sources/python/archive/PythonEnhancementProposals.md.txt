:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).

The current way Python enhancements are officially considered is described in [PEP 1](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/).

This wiki page can be used to capture and discuss enhancements before putting them through the more formal process.

For now, put proposals forth here if you want to try and kick them around a bit and get some feedback before writing an official PEP.

## Enhancement Proposals 

- [RangeGenerator](../people/RangeGenerator)

- [SliceOverNegatives](SliceOverNegatives)

- [IfStatementWithValue](IfStatementWithValue)

- [ArrayInterface](../people/ArrayInterface)

- [Python3kStringRepr](../py3/Python3kStringRepr)

- [Python3UnicodeDecodeError](../py3/Python3UnicodeDecodeError)

## About Using Wiki to Discuss Enhancement Proposals 

Thoughts here on moving the official discussion of Python Enhancements from email to wiki.

See also [PEEPs](PEEPs).

## Discussion of Completed PEPs 

Once a PEP is complete, altering the document to capture ongoing community input has a very high bar. Here are some PEP \"rehash\" pages.
