Session Notes:

Numeric doesn\'t do what we want (although it\'s great for what it does do)

Patrick likes Stata

- Many things can do what we want in SQL

A story by Patrick Multiple systems estimation

- Find intersections of lists
- Create list of presence/absence in the other lists
- Estimate what lies outside

Suggestion from Numarray folks

- Use recarray
- Mutable values, not mutable shape
- Perry describes record arrays in detail (sorry, I didn\'t get this down\...)

Suggestion by Jeff/Abhay

- Use Metakit [http://www.equi4.com/metakit/](http://www.equi4.com/metakit/)

Use R (like S-Plus)

- [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)

- [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)

R + Python has problems. Patrick tells of difficulties passing data between Python and R, even simple stuff like small matrices \-- R gives back data errors (roughly: \"I don\'t understand what this is\").
