Coordination on CLArifying the matters around CLA. Please add your questions, issues and updates here and notify \[[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-legal-sig/](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-legal-sig/) python-legal-sig\] list so that people also interested in resolving the conflict around freedom of contributions can sync and help.

Q (2014-02-07): Can anybody explain CLA to me? Everybody says that I should sign this - [http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/) - but can\'t explain why - is there a FAQ or something?

### Facts 

- (2014-02-07) There is no information explaining CLA or link to CLA FAQ leading from the CLA page - [http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/](http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/)

- Google CLA v1.1 - [https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual)

### Open Petition 

The idea is to create petition that will set the new defaults that will eliminate the need for CLA to free open source software projects from the stuff the hurts collaboration. This includes the proposal that if you submit code that is patented or not yours or can not be submitted because it is under conflicting license - you must say this explicitly. In all other cases you\'re aware of the license projects uses and agree to release your contribution under the same license.
