## Sprint Topic Ideas 

What would participants like to accomplish? Choose from among the ideas below or add new ones. Register your votes below, and feel free to comment.

Right now we have a pair of topics:

- Dump/Restore data in the Chandler Repository as XML to allow backups and version upgrades
- Implement a remote repository using WebDAV as the protocol layer.
- Build a Chandler app/package

We plan to do technical introductions so that people have an idea of how things work in the Repository.

## Comments
