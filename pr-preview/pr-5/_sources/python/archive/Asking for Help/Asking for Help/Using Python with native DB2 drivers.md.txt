## Asking for Help/Using Python with native DB2 drivers 

Has someone tried connecting to DB2 using native driver functionality? Specifically interested in ways to run \"load client from \" from the application server. We are using workarounds today - by calling admin_cmd/ sysproc.db2load procedures after transporting files to the server, but trying to get this to work without so many hacks.
