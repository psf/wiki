Describe PyChecker here.

from [http://pychecker.sourceforge.net](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net)

PyChecker is a [static source analysis](../archive/static%20source%20analysis) tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages, like C and C++. It is similar to lint. Because of the dynamic nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.
