# ShowMeDo

```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).
```

Showmedo.com was a site where creators could upload Video tutorial content - like happens on [YouTube](./YouTube.html) now; in its early days that kind of content was quite uncommon. There used to be a of lot great Python content. The main site is no longer running; the wiki page has been hacked and has tons of dodgy content. Some of the original content \*may\* still be findable at [The internet archive](https://archive.org/). The Python wiki no longer tries to maintain links to former ShowMeDo content given the problems.
