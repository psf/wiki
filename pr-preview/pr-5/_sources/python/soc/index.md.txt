# Summer of Code

Python has participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and related programs since 2005, mentoring students and interns who contribute to Python and its ecosystem of sub-projects. Current GSoC coordination has moved to [python-gsoc.org](http://python-gsoc.org/), but the wiki archives years of project ideas, student proposals, and program logistics.
