# Guides and How-Tos

A collection of practical guides written by community members over the years. These cover specific tasks -- packaging, exception handling, building executables, working with Tkinter -- rather than teaching Python from scratch. Some pages are well-maintained; others are historical artifacts from the MoinMoin wiki era. Check dates and versions before following any advice here too literally.

## General How-To Collections

- [How to...](How%20to.../index) -- an index of various "how to" pages covering common Python tasks
- [HowTo](HowTo/index) -- another collected set of how-to guides and recipes
- [How to...](How%20to...) -- single-page quick reference for assorted Python tasks
- [HowTo](HowTo) -- landing page for how-to articles

## Getting Help

- [Asking for Help](Asking%20for%20Help/index) -- advice on how to ask good Python questions and where to ask them
- [How to start learning Python?](How%20to%20start%20learning%20Python_%20Any%20suggestions) -- community suggestions for new learners looking for direction

- [Mutable Buffers in Python 2.3](How%20to%20have%20a%20mutable%20buffer%20with%20python%202.3_) -- working with mutable byte buffers in older Python

## Tkinter and Tcl

- [How Tkinter Can Exploit Tcl](How%20Tkinter%20can%20exploit%20Tcl/index) -- using Tcl features and extensions from within Tkinter

## Code Snippets
