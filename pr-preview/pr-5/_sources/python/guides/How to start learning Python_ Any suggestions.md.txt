Answer

:   

\* **Just Use It** \-- many people just start using Python from day one, referring to [example code](../archive/Is%20there%20any%20tiny%20project%20or%20source%20for%20participation%20or%20reference) and the [language and library reference](http://docs.python.org/) while working on solving a real problem. This works well for most experienced programmers, starting with some smaller coding tasks. Be sure to skim the extensive library reference to get an idea of what modules are available for your use.

\* For more gentle introductions, see the [Beginners Guide](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
