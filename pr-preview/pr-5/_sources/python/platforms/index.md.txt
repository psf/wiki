# Platform-Specific

Running Python on different operating systems sometimes requires platform-specific knowledge. This section covers macOS, Windows, and Android topics, along with commercial Python distributions. Some of these pages are quite old -- Windows compiler compatibility tables for Python 2.x, for instance -- but they capture real problems people hit at the time.

## macOS

- [MacPython](MacPython) — Python on macOS, including FAQ, AppleScript integration, and Mac-specific software
- [MacPython](MacPython/index) — subpages covering Mac-specific Python topics in depth
- [MacQuigg](MacQuigg) — Don MacQuigg's Python pages

## Windows

- [WindowsCompilers](WindowsCompilers) — which C++ compilers to use for building Python extensions on Windows, version by version
- [WindowsBooks](WindowsBooks) — books about Python development on Windows
- [Py2Exe](Py2Exe) — compiling Python scripts into Windows executables
- [Win32All](Win32All) — the win32all package for Windows API access from Python

## Android

- [Android](Android) — comparison of projects for running Python on Android, from Kivy to BeeWare

## Commercial Distributions

- [ActivePython](ActivePython) — ActiveState's commercial Python distribution with bundled packages and cross-platform support
- [ActiveState](ActiveState) — ActiveState, the company behind ActivePython and Komodo

## Other

- [Admin](Admin/index) — administrative subpages
- [MaciejOlko](MaciejOlko/index) — Maciej Olko's contributed pages
