I\'m lucky enough to spend a fair amount of my time at work coding in Python, as well as the majority of my home/hobby time. I\'m working on a game with my seven-year-old daughter using [PyGame](../multimedia/PyGame) and I participate in the [Edu-Sig](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig) mailing list. Currently I\'m exploring the use of PyObjC to wrap some of the work I\'m doing on [data-level collaboration](http://www.svgopen.org/2003/papers/SVGAndCollaborativeWeb/). I\'ve been working extensively with XML since it was called SGML-Web and with Python for the past several years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-work projects I\'ve been working on, most of which will be using PyObjC and/or [PyGame](../multimedia/PyGame):

- Quick-fix to \[Pathological\] so multiple logins share high-scores. My kids really love this game (so do I)

- Game framework in [PyGame](../multimedia/PyGame) to make it easier and faster to develop games, including:

  - [FayRay](./FayRay.html), a map-based fairy game with my 7 year-old daughter contributing graphics and game design

  - [BoggleTrainer](./BoggleTrainer.html), a port of Boggle which \"solves\" puzzle, makes spelling suggestions, and looks up definitions of words, gives hints, etc. to help with kids\' spelling and vocabulary

  - [GoMoku](./GoMoku.html), playable now, needs some tweaks

  - Kutia, a Logo-like turtle-graphics tool to explain programming

  - Quipu, a hex-based path game

- PyObjC clone of [Oblique Strategies](http://www.curvedspace.org/software/oblique.html) so I can add my other quotes and also to learn [PyObjC](./PyObjC.html)

- Port \[VPython\] to OS X natively (not using X Windows)

- I contribute occasionally to [reStructuredText](../archive/reStructuredText)

- VPython explorations to visual geometry for kids (fun for grownups too)

- Command-line access to OS X\'s VTwin search engine

If anyone is interested in seeing these, let me know and I\'ll make them public sooner.
