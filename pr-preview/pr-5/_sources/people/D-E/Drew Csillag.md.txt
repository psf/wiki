## Drew Csillag 

[Here](http://www.geocities.com/drew_csillag) and [elsewhere](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=%22Drew+Csillag%22).

Author of [SkunkWeb](SkunkWeb).

Also recently wrote a program that can take a core dump file produced by a python interpreter and output a python stack trace. Very useful when you have a C extension that is misbehaving and you\'re not sure which one it is. Email me or the [SkunkWeb mailling list](mailto:skunkweb-list@lists.sourceforge.net) if you\'re interested.
