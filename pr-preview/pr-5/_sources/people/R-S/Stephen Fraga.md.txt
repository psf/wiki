Email: \[firstname\]@\[company\].com where my company is [Prompt Yes!](https://promptyes.com)

I run a training company offering [ChatGPT](https://promptyes.com/classes/productivity/), [Midjourney](https://promptyes.com/classes/midjourney/), and other AI tools. We will soon be listing a \"AI Development in Python\" class.

I used to work at another training company that offered python classes; I still know many of the Python trainers, so if you need one, feel free to send me an email.
