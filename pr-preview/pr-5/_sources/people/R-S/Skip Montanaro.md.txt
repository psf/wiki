## Skip Montanaro 

Email: `<skip@python.org>`

I spend more time than I should but less time than I\'d like noodling around with Python. I\'m lucky though. I\'m retired now, but [TradeLink](https://tradelinkllc.com/) and [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/) used to pay me to program in Python. I also ride ([mostly](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmj3b97L) [vintage](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmNGcmr9)) bikes and even took a framebuilding class where I was able to [create my own frame](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjzHZes).
