## Sarah Dutkiewicz 

I\'m the [PyOhio](../conferences/regional/PyOhio) Publicity Pythonista for [PyOhio](../conferences/regional/PyOhio) 2009, and I look forward to getting the word out about this awesome event.

My Python involvement right now is still young - I spoke at [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) 2009 on [IronPython](../implementations/IronPython), and I speak in the Microsoft Heartland District (OH/MI/KY/TN) on [IronPython](../implementations/IronPython). I hope to have an [IronPython](../implementations/IronPython) Getting Started Guide up on my site soon.

If you want to get a hold of me, I can be reached at \<sarah AT codinggeekette DOT com\>.
