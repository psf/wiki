```{admonition} Legacy Wiki Page
:class: note

This page was migrated from the old MoinMoin-based wiki. Information may be outdated or no longer applicable. For current documentation, see [python.org](https://www.python.org).

## Max Fuxjäger 

I made this wiki account to cleanup old and dead links to other pages. Since this task is repetitive i am thinking of building a bot.

### Wiki Pages I want to edit 

[PythonXml](../archive/PythonXml): Does not mention xmlschema, has dead links

### Contact 

Email: Rather not disclose. In the future, here will be an e-mail address you can spam-rape.

If you want to contact me, either edit this page in a gentle fashion or ask around on the mailing list for my e-mail address. If you do not know which mailing list - well, let\'s call it spam protection.
