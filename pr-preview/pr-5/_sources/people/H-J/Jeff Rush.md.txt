Located in Dallas, my background is in software development for Zope2, Zope3, Twisted, Numeric, ZODB, a bit of Quixote and Durus, and psycopg/Postgre\`SQL. I also am experienced in extending Python using C/C++, most recently to hook Python into the Cepstral/Festival Lite speech synthesis engine and real time ALSA audio playback.

Organizationally I started the [DFW Pythoneers](http://www.dfwpython.org)user group, the affiliated [Python meetup group](http://python.meetup.com/10), am an officer in the [DFW Unix user group](http://www.dfwuug.org), cyberarchivist of [Sunless-Sea Xanadu site](http://www.sunless-sea.net)and organizer of the [North Texas Xanadu hypertext meetup group](http://xanadu.meetup.com/1). I also worked with the local group to bring [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) 2005 to Dallas and will be co-chair for [PyCon](../conferences/pycon/PyCon) 2006, also in Dallas.

I\'m a self-employed consultant and have worked in robotics, monetary currency recognition/processing, security and packaging of Red Hat RPMs.

Python is my preferred language and what I do for fun.
