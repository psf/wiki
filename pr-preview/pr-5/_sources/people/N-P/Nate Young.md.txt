NateYoung is a Java programmer who recently finished the book \"Learning Python\" and got very excited about the language in a way that he hasn\'t been since, well, since he learned Java.

He works for a large, faceless, proprietary company by day, so he\'s very interested in Open Source Software and exorcising some of the stigmas his corporate workplace has against free software. Jython seemed like a natural point to delve into those interests and utilize his Java-bilities.

He\'s been reading the wiki and some of the mail archives, hopefully he\'ll come up to speed quickly and be able to pitch in where help is needed.
