## Patrick Harris 

Basically, I am new to Python Web and Applications Development. My Python knowledge is beginner to novice and I will accept any and all help. I will attempt to help anyone that ask for my help, therefore feel free to contact me at Email: `<harrispp64@gmail.com>`.

My goal is to use Python to extend and/or develop useful technologies to incorporate into Google Wave. However, my work will not end there as I am very adventurous and plan to do all that I can with Python and Ruby\...maybe a little C++\...yet I will concentrate on Python development at present!

Please always remember that I am no one\...yet I am everyone!
