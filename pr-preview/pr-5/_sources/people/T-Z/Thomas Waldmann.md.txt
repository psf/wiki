IRC: I am often on #moin and #moin-dev on chat.freenode.net (and also on #python, #python.de, \...). I don\'t use a nickname, but just `ThomasWaldmann`{.backtick}.

I am the [MoinMoin wiki project](http://moinmo.in/) administrator and joined the PSF in 2009.

If you have any moin questions / wishes, just ask. ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png%20":)")

### Ideas for PSF wiki 

#### General 

- more people could create their personal home page, so it is linked from [RecentChanges](RecentChanges) when they do edits

  - or, alternatively, they could check the option in their user settings to publish their email there instead

- when creating your homepage, make sure you subscribe to it, so when somebody puts something there for you, you\'ll get notified by email

#### Technical 

- 1.7.1 is a bit old already (debian?), 1.8.x would look a bit fresher (\"modernized\" theme)
  - this is nothing pressing, but if folks here would be happy with something fresher, I offer to help with upgrading

- this wiki is using xapian indexed search. xapian is for sure faster than the non-indexed standard search of moin, but as the PSF wiki does not have many pages, maybe the non-indexed search would be fast enough and work better (indexed search can only find stuff that was put into the index, the slow search also can find any substrings).
  - if indexing of file attachments is important, stay with xapian as the slow search can\'t search attachments

- action menu:
  - has [CopyPage](./CopyPage.html) - the semantics of this action are a bit strange, if you do not really use it, maybe rather disable it

  - does have \"Load\", but not \"Save\" - did people confuse \"Save\" with saving in the editor or why?

- rst parser usage - hey, there seem to be some `ReST`{.backtick} users here! ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png%20":)") I have been (unsuccessfully) trying for a while to get some maintainer for the rst parser in [MoinMoin](MoinMoin), it definitely needs some more love but noone of the current moin devs is using it in production.

### PSF membership application form 

When filling out that stuff, I found it a bit uncomfortable that I had to paste stuff from a web page into a document. I am attaching the document I created in the hope it will be useful (if you use it, I suggest you use the .odt version except if someone manages to make a PDF with a form that can be filled out on the computer - you don\'t want to read the typical geek\'s handwriting!):

- [Original OpenOffice.org text document](attachments/ThomasWaldmann/psf.odt "Original OpenOffice.org text document")

- [PDF \"printout\" of the document](attachments/ThomasWaldmann/psf.pdf "PDF "printout" of the document")

![(!)](/wiki/europython/img/idea.png%20"(!)") BTW, for the non-native english speaker it might be a bit unclear what you want to hear on the \"affiliation\" line. Is that my favourite python project? My company? My Python User Group? Something else? I looked up that word in a dictionary, but even after that, I couldn\'t make too much sense of it (I put \"[MoinMoin](MoinMoin) Wiki\" in there, hoping that this is what PSF wanted to hear).
