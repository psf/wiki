## Andrew Cates 

Email: my first name at [http://catesfamily.org.uk/](http://catesfamily.org.uk/) without the http bit of course. Alternatively you can find me at [AndrewCates](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AndrewCates "Wiki") or [AndrewCates](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?AndrewCates "MeatBall") or [AndrewCates](http://www.zwiki.org/AndrewCates "ZWiki")?

Beginner on Python but like to look and learn, perhaps I should have a look at [PythonBooks](../books/PythonBooks). This site has the freshest and best [FrontPage](FrontPage) and layout I have seen. However the juxtaposition of \"Home Help\" looks like you are offering to drop round and do the dishes for us, and I am not sure why it doesn\'t go to the \"[HelpContents](HelpContents)\" page\... the [SiteNavigation](./SiteNavigation.html) is pretty clear though.

I\'ll write a bit more when I have had a look around.
