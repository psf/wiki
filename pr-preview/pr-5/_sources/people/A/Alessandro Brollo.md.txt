## Your Name 

I\'m Alex, I am a middle-aged Italian pathologist, but it isn\'t my work that pulled me here; it has been my layman work into Wikipedia, mainly into [it.wikisource](http://it.wikisource.org), where I drive a Python bot. I saw a couple of times the word \"Jython\" but I never drag the issue before. I use Python (far from skilly\...) and I\'m just approaching Java, and at a first glance I suppose that Jython is great to learn it!
