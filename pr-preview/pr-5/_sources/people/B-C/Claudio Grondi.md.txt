Started to write computer programs using Algol 60 and Fortran running on a mainframe computer.

Learned to program in APL, MS-DOS QuickBasic , MySQL, PHP, C, C++, MS Visual Basic and MS Visual C++ and to write DHTML pages using JavaScript.

If you are interested in playing against or programming your first own JavaScript engine for the five-in-a-row game check out my online page:

My first own Python scripts are dated 2003.

\# 2005-10-12 : uploaded the HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onWindows.py to [http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onWindows.py](http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onWindows.py) and HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onLinux.py to [http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onLinux.py](http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives_onLinux.py) . For more details on this subject check out the thread \" Wanted: Python module allowing direct access to raw sectors of harddrives (MFT, boot sector, etc.) in MS Windows \", initiated on 2005-10-10 in comp.lang.python.

\# 2005-04-09 : posted to comp.lang.python a Python script (pyMBM.py) querying the shared memory area exposed by the freeware MBM 5 utility (available from [http://mbm.livewiredev.com/](http://mbm.livewiredev.com/)) for tracking motherboard sensory information as temperatures, fan speeds and voltages.

\# 2005-02-07 : uploaded my own version of Console.py to [http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/Console.py](http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/Console.py) Console.py is part of the readline module and is used by e.g. IPython. In my version the (extended) Console() class supports any ANSI escape sequences of the form ESC\[#m and ESC\[#,#m , making it possible to set any by console supported text and background colors.
