Christos \"TZOTZIOY\" Georgiou

Email: [tzot@sil-tec.gr](mailto:tzot@sil-tec.gr)

I am actually working for the SGI dealers for the general area of the Balcans plus Malta and Cyprus. I\'ve been developing with C and databases since 1989 (main experience with Ingres database), and I have worked a lot as a sysadm and netadm (sp? anyway, the guy that makes networks working and in a secure way). I guess that\'s all the basic background one would like to know about me\[0\]. Plus that whenever I can, I like to make people laugh (or smile).

PS In case you wonder, consider TZOTZIOY as just a unique tag, or ask google ![:)](/wiki/europython/img/smile.png%20":)")

\[0\] I also have a 8.5 inch disk. And that when it\'s floppy.
