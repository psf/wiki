### SQLAlchemy on Jython

**Status**: Jython is supported as of SQLAlchemy 0.6 via zxJDBC. Requires Jython 2.5.1. See [SQLAlchemy 0.6 Supported Database Engines](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/06/dbengine.html#supported-dbapis)

### Older SQLAlchemy 0.5 support

- Jonathan Ellis made an experimental Oracle backend for SQLAlchemy 0.5: [http://pylonshq.com/pasties/77c3184b14d6936d86d13e4e65df92d2](http://pylonshq.com/pasties/77c3184b14d6936d86d13e4e65df92d2) Some other zxJDBC dialects would likely follow this example. Reports are it works under 0.5 but not 0.5.2: [http://pieceofpy.com/index.php/2009/03/13/jython-25-and-snakefight-for-deploying-pylons-w-sqlalchemy-oracle/](http://pieceofpy.com/index.php/2009/03/13/jython-25-and-snakefight-for-deploying-pylons-w-sqlalchemy-oracle/)
