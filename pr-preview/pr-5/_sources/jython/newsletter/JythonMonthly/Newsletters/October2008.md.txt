Happy Halloween Jython Enthusiasts! This is always a good time of year for me as I enjoy the fall weather, but it is also a busy time of the year. The schedules are getting booked with end of the year expectations and the holiday season that awaits. This distribution of Jython Monthly is a bit late, but it is full of good news and content and I hope you\'ll be pleased.

The results are in, and it is a bit of a mixed bag. More readers would prefer that the Jython Monthly distribution is turned into a podcast, but there are still a significant number of you who would like it to stay the same. With that being said, I am going to work on continuing the newsletter in it\'s current format and adding a short podcast each month to cover those of you who would prefer to listen. Please stay tuned in the coming weeks for more information.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or tutorials/articles you\'d like to add then please feel free to send them my way.

## Articles 

**Getting Started with Django - My Experiences** *Submitted By: Josh Juneau*

You may ask why we need another web framework, or what a different web framework may do to make my applications or development life cycle better. Obviously the developers of the Django web framework had some key goals in mind when they set upon their journey to create Django. I believe that their goal was simplicity and ability. These are two of the key factors that come into play for many of today\'s web frameworks. Ruby on Rails was the one of the pioneers in this area. Not long after, many other great application development languages came up with similar powerful frameworks. For example, Grails is also gaining momentum in the Groovy/Java developer community.
