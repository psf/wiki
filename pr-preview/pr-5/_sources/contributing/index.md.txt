# Contributing

This is a 4,000+ page Sphinx site built from Markdown files. The original content came from MoinMoin (the wiki engine that powered wiki.python.org for two decades), converted to [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) and rendered with the [Shibuya](https://shibuya.lepture.com/) theme.

There are two ways to contribute: edit files directly through GitHub, or use the browser-based CMS. Both end up as pull requests against the `main` branch.
