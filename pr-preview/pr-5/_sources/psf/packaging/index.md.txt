# Packaging

The PSF has played a direct role in funding and coordinating improvements to Python's packaging infrastructure -- pip, PyPI (Warehouse), and the broader toolchain. This section documents those efforts, from funded improvement proposals to sprint coordination and project roadmaps.

## Funding & Proposals

- [Fundable Packaging Improvements](Fundable%20Packaging%20Improvements) -- Curated list of well-scoped packaging projects that could be funded, maintained on GitHub
- [Pip 2020 Donor-Funded Roadmap](Pip2020DonorFundedRoadmap) -- The CZI- and Mozilla-funded project to finish pip's dependency resolver and improve its UX

## PyPI / Warehouse

- [Warehouse Roadmap](WarehouseRoadmap) -- Development roadmap for the new PyPI (Warehouse), with links to current and archived milestones
- [Warehouse Package Maintainer Testing](WarehousePackageMaintainerTesting) -- Call for PyPI maintainers to beta-test authentication and security improvements

## Sprints

- [Packaging Sprints](PackagingSprints) -- Information for contributors who want to join packaging sprints and work on pip, setuptools, Warehouse, and related tools
