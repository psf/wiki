Dev mini syncup

17 Mar, PM, PG, TPC

- PRs are more or less done, but Paul would be happier if we can get an extra pair of eyes to look at them, not merging for the sake of it.
  - The `is_direct`{.backtick} stuff is stopping pip install from working

  - Pradyun: Just drop the assertion that\'s causing issues. The property/attribute is needed for the old/legacy resolver.

  - `is_direct`{.backtick} is for the old resolver upgrade strategy stuff. Not needed (yet?) in new resolver - upgrade strategies for new resolver not discussed yet

  - Paul: Or make the candidates `is_direct`{.backtick} (feels like it's introducing more hacks)
- Pradyun will try to take a look of both PRs and merge them in maybe tomorrow.
- Paul wants to take a look at Pradyun's documentation work as well?
  - Pradyun to ping Paul on the CLI docs PR.
- Who other than Pradyun is familiar with pip's command parsing stuff? (Nobody)
  - Pradyun: \*sad smiley\*
