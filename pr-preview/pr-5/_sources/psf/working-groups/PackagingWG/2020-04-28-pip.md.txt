Resolver Dev Syncup (28 April 2020)

Participants:

- Paul
- Pradyun
- Tzu-Ping

Agenda:

- pip 20.1 release
- test failures
  - [https://trello.com/b/tydA30lP/new-resolver-for-pip-fix-the-failing-tests](https://trello.com/b/tydA30lP/new-resolver-for-pip-fix-the-failing-tests) (maybe do not include in public notes?)
- 20.1 and resolver work
  - Merge the existing resolver PRs into a single PR so we can sort out the merge conflicts in advance. Paul will do this.
    - Paul will take a look at his monolithic merged PRs branch\'s failures.
- Visualization work
  - Update on work / discussion on the visualization design

  - Graphviz!!!

  - Paul: Looks good.

  - Tzu-Ping: Do we expect a random user to understand this graph?
    - Pradyun: no?

  - Q: Where does this fit in?
    - Pradyun: beside resolvelib. maybe?

  - [https://github.com/sarugaku/resolvelib/issues/46#issuecomment-620106093](https://github.com/sarugaku/resolvelib/issues/46#issuecomment-620106093)

(bringing other discussions / past discussions)

- pip upgrade package \[package \...\]
  - TP: Definitely better than `pip install --upgrade`{.backtick}---if we can ever convince the users :p

- pip command to open project URL ( pypi.org/project/\<name\>/\<version\> ) to let the user have easy access to metadata.

  - TP: Think about this again, the setup.py I want to read is almost never the frontmost code on [GitHub](./GitHub.html) (that's master, I want a specific version). A more viable solution would be for Warehouse to implement a "view content in sdist" page, and we link to that.

  - TP: Wiew wheel metadata is less useful because most people don't understand Core Metadata format anyway

  - TODO: TP files a feature request to Warehouse

- Paul: We should try to not distract ourselves away from the tedious work of fixing the test failures though.

- When pip install fails, dump a "postmortem" in a file instead of cluttering the console
  - TP thinks this is a good idea, but we need to keep CI in mind (where the log file is not accessible, only the console)
  - NPM and Yarn both dump an error file on failures, but they still puts up verbose messages in the console
  - Pradyun: things to log:
    - choice made
    - discarding choice (backtracking)
    - note dependencies as discovered
    - I\'m doing a download now! (TP thinks this is unnecessary)
  - Paul: More thinking about dumping the \"state of the resolver\" at the time of the exception for analysis
    - Dependency graph, in some serialised (machine readable) form.
      - TP It can be difficult to decide "which" graph to dump on multiple backtracking. Maybe dump the graph on each backtracking?
    - Discarded candidates, maybe, if resolvelib still has a record of them.
