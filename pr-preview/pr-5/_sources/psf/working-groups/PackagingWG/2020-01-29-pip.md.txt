pip syncup meeting

UX Bernard, Sumana, Georgia 29 Jan 2020

- Go through the UX issues (from the wiki) and make sure that we understand each of them
  - BT/GB do it later in detail.
  - Simply Secure to review the tickets and write notes in the wiki

- Understand the tagging system etc
  - later - do in detail, maybe Zulip

- Scheduling a telephone call with the maintainers
  - to understand \"how does pip work\"
    - Bernard read:
      - start with [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/getting-started/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/getting-started/)

      - [https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/presentations/](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/presentations/)

      - [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/architecture/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/architecture/)

      - Also read [https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/jan/05/packaging/](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/jan/05/packaging/)

      - ask (better) questions to dev
    - can we be onboarded as new-contributors
  - their understanding of users issues and frustrations

- Talk about collaboration modes, e.g. longer term work, shorter term needs
  - Zulip & irc: Are there connected rooms? What rooms/streams are the right rooms?

    - IRC is popular in the community, usually on freenode

    - #debian-python on OFTC where some people are

    - community/outreach/office hours: spend time in IRC to community (but also see \"User Interviews / Participant Outreach\" section below)

    - devs/maintainers: comms via Zulip

    - Can connect an irc client to Zulip \> Sumana will send to Bernard, but also look for that and see if you can find the tool

      - Pradyun, barging in on these notes: PSF\'s zulip instance seems to have \"IRC\" stream with the \"#python-dev\" topic, watching Freenode\'s #python-dev.

- PIP!
  - pip download packages

  - setuptools \-- part of making a package

  - twine \> uploadibg package to to pypi website

  - warehouse \> drives the db for pypi website

  - Sumana has been sheparding all devs into zulip (not all are there yet)

  - Bernard rtfm pip readme

  - check out chat.zulip.org - Zulip about

- GitHub: Can we have a UX project or some tags in some way on GitHub so we\'re in the same ecosystem? Should we just use the packaging-problems repo as our main place on GitHub? can we use issues in that repo: [https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues](https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues)?

  - Go ahead and use pypa/packaging-problems.

- User Interviews / Participant Outreach
  - OK to go ahead and start doing outreach?
    - pass the recruitment content via Sumana and she\'ll give us feedback about direct to or via Sumana
  - Or should we go via Sumana/PyFo to start talking to potential users?
  - Where should/can we discuss this outreach?
  - Below are some places to start.
