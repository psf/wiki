Education Ecosystem (LEDU) is a project-based learning platform that teaches professional developers and students how to build real products in areas such as programming, game development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, and blockchain. Content is organized around projects where students learn from watching videos of developers building products. The main participants in the ecosystem are project creators, viewers, moderators, API developers, and developer-focused companies.
